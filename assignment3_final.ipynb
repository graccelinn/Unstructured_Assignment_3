They lost everything in that basement. I want to help them recover from this because it is terrible what this flood has done. These animals deserve good, happy lives. My Mitzvah Project is how I will help. For every $40 donated to this fundraiser in all, I will crochet a cat toy. In the end, all the money and cat toys will be donated.

Campaign descriptions alone captures meaningful patterns that help distinguish successful efforts from less effective ones.\n",

When both image and text features were combined, accuracy reached 80.81%, just slightly below the text-only model. Overall, all three models performed well, highlighting that both written and visual elements provide valuable insight into what drives campaign success."

This is because after performing topic modeling on both parts as well as the parts combined, using image labels is what produced the best 'aha' moment. Additionally, the 76.26% accuracy makes it clear that images alone are still providing some valuable information towards the amount that campaigns can raise."

We decided these are too similar, so we combined these into one topic called **Happiness**. The three other topics are **Cats**, **Dogs**, and **Structures**.

        "While this isn't a huge margin for any of the topics between high-raising and low-raising campaigns, we find it very interesting that images relating to cats and dogs would have a lower appearance in high-raising campaigns for animal shelters. After looking through example images for high-raising campaigns that are also high in the Structures topic, we discovered that some of these photos are images of a building, but many of them are photos of animals behind some sort of cage or wire fencing. Based on this realization, **we recommend animal shelters to use photos that play on the heartstrings of donors**. It appears that simple pet photos do not earn as much money as emotional photos, whether through positive emotions (Happiness) or negative emotion (animals kept behind structures)."
