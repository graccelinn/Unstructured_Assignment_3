"Help Baby Jenson Fight a Rare Brain Cancer","Dear friends, family, and kind-hearted strangers,

We are reaching out with heavy hearts to ask for your support for the Park family and their beautiful baby boy, Jenson.

At just 10 months old, Jenson has been diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer. Doctors discovered a tumour in his tiny head — heartbreakingly, it's the size of a lemon. No child should ever have to face something so unimaginable, and no parent should ever have to watch their baby suffer through such a terrifying diagnosis.","$49,046","55K","September 17th, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/vfQ_a6e1pE7GZrlsdMgruTKPhPc=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94659553_1758094061157232_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-baby-jenson-fight-a-rare-brain-cancer?qid=651c88ec8f2fa027271b474fe21b11fa","Child, Hospital, Patient, Health Care, Medical equipment, Medical, Medical procedure, Infant, Toddler, Hospital bed"
"Dennis’s Fight Against Stage 4 Esophageal Cancer","Dennis was diagnosed with esophageal cancer on July 16, 2025 and given a stage 4 designation on August 6, 2025. He will soon begin treatment. As many of you can imagine, this next chapter will bring both physical and financial challenges.

The immediate plan is several (3-4) months of chemotherapy. If treatment goes well—if the tumor in his liver is cleared and the tumor near his stomach shrinks—surgery may become an option. That would mean an even longer road to recovery, possibly adding an additional 6–12 months before Dennis could fully get back on his feet.

For those who know Dennis, you know he pours his heart and soul into Vandemic Campervans, the business he and our brother, Rick, have built together. Dennis is the architect and builder behind their beautiful conversions. Sadly, with treatment ahead and the difficult side effects that come with it, the decision was made to “pause” Vandemic Campervans for now. That means Dennis is facing this battle without his usual source of income.","$40,758","50K","September 10th, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/ybPT_3fBXkCoE-5h3PPcrxLfvW0=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94366447_1757128628526373_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/denniss-fight-against-stage-4-esophageal-cancer?qid=4f16241eb1fc2f0f06f4377fc6d558a3","Mountainous landforms, Mountain, People in nature, Vacation, Recreation, Geology, Happiness, Leisure, Travel, Mountain range"

"Val Beats Cancer","My name is Michel, and I am Val’s friend from the Swedish side of the family. For those who know Val (Valence) Andrew, you already know the kind of man he is. For those who don’t, let me paint you a picture. Val is a devoted father, brother, grandfather, uncle and a loyal friend. Someone with a heart so big that everyone who meets him feels seen, heard, and cared for. He is the kind of person who would give you his last, who carries empathy and positivity everywhere he goes, and who always finds a way to lift others up—even in his own darkest moments.

In February 2025, Val’s world was shaken when he was diagnosed with colon cancer. He underwent a major surgery to remove the tumor, and shortly after, began six grueling months of intense chemotherapy. Through it all, he stayed strong, hopeful, and continued to shine his light for others. When the treatment recently ended, we all breathed a sigh of relief, thinking the worst was finally behind him.","kr 182,585","250K","8 d ago","https://images.gofundme.com/wFGJwwut3CIRy0_9GYjnS3n7tRM=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94972421_1758713435330384_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/val-beats-cancer?qid=3ab25b990d56125d05daa92ab02472bc","Head, Happiness, Face, Nose, Mouth, Eye, Facial expression, Child, Smile, Ear"

The lymphoma caused a high blood calcium level which led to Cooper getting rapidly more ill from Monday to Tuesday. Cooper was taken to the UWVC Emergency Clinic on Tuesday morning where he was admitted, had further diagnostics of the mass in his chest, and was transferred to the UWVC Oncology Service for his first chemotherapy treatment and initiation of supportive care to try to help him feel better. Unfortunately, before bringing Cooper home, he also developed aspiration pneumonia as a likely consequence of his low white blood cell count and vomiting earlier in the week.

James is at a stage in his life where things all started to come together and fall into place. Just last month, he married a gorgeous woman, Agnes, who he's been waiting for his whole life.

In May of this year, they packed up his parents and brought them to live together under one roof. They never imagined that just a few months later, they'd be facing a cancer diagnosis that would turn their lives upside down.","$4,085","13K","4 d ago","https://images.gofundme.com/kNeBzovHcN205bewhvFwvjxbezU=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/95091829_1759010160638530_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-support-jason-in-his-fight-against-stage-4-colon-cancer?qid=4fba666206ab44eab89a5cb2633861fc","Smile, Happiness, Beard, Facial hair, Facial expression, Interior design, Tooth, Comfort, Moustache, Fun"
"Help John Killian Get Through Pancreatic Cancer","Hi, I’m writing on behalf of my brother John (originally from Natchez, MS, currently in Raleigh NC), who recently received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. He’s a kind, talented and hard-working guy who gives the shirt off his back to others, and now he needs a squad to rally for him.

What’s Going On

The treatments (radiation, medication, hospital stays) are overwhelming in cost and intensity. John has used all of his savings, sold everything he owns (even all his podcast gear and musical instruments), and leaned on family and friends as far as possible. But the costs have continued to mount - both medical and living expenses.","$9,635","10K","2 d ago","https://images.gofundme.com/gO1CRJXk8odzTnDs4gQ6AiMMKYY=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94966325_1758685490456950_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/john-killian-get-through-pancreatic-cancer?qid=32fd28d65c9d2906df7b87ba92214e4a","Patient, Medical equipment, Facial hair, Medical, Hospital, Beard, Health Care, Hospital gown, Watch, Moustache"
"Support Brandon & Tracy’s Cancer Journey","Brandon and Tracy have always been the kind of people who put others first—whether it’s supporting a neighbor, lending a hand, or showing up when someone is in need. Now, they are facing one of the toughest challenges of their lives. Just a couple of weeks ago, Brandon, who is 44 years old, was diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and their world was turned upside down overnight. Brandon works full-time for the City of Fortuna, and Tracy is a dedicated full-time hospice nurse. Together, they are raising two children who depend on their love and strength every single day.

Since the diagnosis, their family has been swept into a whirlwind of medical appointments, long-distance travel, and overwhelming uncertainty. They are making frequent five-hour trips to UCSF to meet with specialists and plan for treatment—trips that mean missed work, hotel stays, meals away from home, and the strain of leaving their kids behind while trying to maintain a sense of normalcy. On top of travel and lodging, lost wages and upcoming medical expenses add another layer of financial stress to an already difficult journey.

Anyone who knows Brandon and Tracy knows their hearts for others. They are always the first to give, to help, and to serve. Now, they need their community to rally around them. Your support will go directly toward travel costs, lodging, medical expenses, lost wages, and caring for their children as they walk through this challenging season and work toward Brandon’s recovery.

Love, prayers, and positive thoughts are also deeply appreciated by their family as they face this road ahead with courage and hope.","$10,865","13K","September 23rd, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/Keo0orn3Mt1Qwz5OMsIe8fg3OzI=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94948173_1758672208343612_r.jpeg","https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-brandon-tracys-cancer-journey?qid=040d84072ca3a0db1fdee5821484f1b4","People, Smile, Sleeve, Happiness, Hat, Jeans, Headgear, Denim, Friendship, Beard"

In addition to working at Plainridge Park and Casino since 1999, Tracy has also worked in the racing industry at Bally’s (Twin River) and Raynham Park. She always takes pride in her work and is very efficient in doing so. Tracy has accumulated a wide group of friends in this industry and that is why we are reaching out to them.

Recently, Tracy has been diagnosed with an incurable hormonal cancer. She was originally diagnosed as Stage 3 cancer with a lump in her breast, but they soon found spots in her lymph nodes, liver, and stomach. The expected life expectancy with this type of cancer is five years. While this cancer cannot be cured, it may be able to be somewhat maintained with medication and offer Tracy the necessary time to spend with her children, grandchildren, other relatives, and friends.

"Help Meagan Fight Stage 3 Colon Cancer","Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out on behalf of my best friend, Meagan, who at just 24 years old has been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer. This devastating news came right after she graduated with her Master’s degree and teaching credential, a dream she worked so hard for, only to have her future turned upside down in an instant.

 On June 27th, Meagan had to undergo urgent surgery to remove 25 cm of her colon. Now she faces a long road ahead with chemotherapy, follow-up treatments, and countless doctor visits.

Because of the intensity of Meagan’s treatment and recovery, she cannot work. We’re asking for your help to ease the financial burden of daily living expenses and the extra medical costs not covered by insurance.

One of the most heartbreaking realities of chemotherapy is that it can cause infertility. Meagan has been advised to freeze her eggs to preserve her chance at having a family in the future, something that is incredibly important to her. Unfortunately, this procedure is not covered by insurance and will cost approximately $15,000.

Every donation, no matter the size, will help cover medical expenses, fertility preservation, treatment costs, and basic living needs while she’s unable to work.

If you can’t donate, please consider sharing this page with your friends and family. Your support, prayers, and positive thoughts mean the world to her and everyone who loves her.

After many doctor’s visits and scans, my treatment has finally begun with hormonal injections and chemotherapy. My intention is to get through this and extend my life beyond what the doctors convey as a prognosis. I’m here to fight, and as much of a peace lover as I am, it’s time to kick this cancer’s butt.","$18,319","22K","3 d ago","https://images.gofundme.com/xLsViq58lvIGwYIQRoCRej4EUx8=/720x405/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N9dsLsyK-yU/0.jpg","https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-marcell-get-through-chemo-and-kick-cancers-butt?qid=1e68b82ef99df1ad57dd551fd74d23a9","Neck, Wrinkle, Backyard, Houseplant"

"Support Peggy Doll's Fight Against Cancer","My wonderful aunty, Peggy Doll, was diagnosed with lung cancer almost 2 years ago. After undergoing chemo, she started immunotherapy and went back to work. However, the toll on her body has become untenable. She is severely immunocompromised and is constantly picking up illnesses that complicate her already uncomfortable side effects and leave her unable to continue working in an office environment. She needs our support as she leaves her beloved office family to find work she can do from home; she needs more opportunities to rest and less chance of sickness that can keep her from providing for her family.

She shares, ""Your help with my continuing journey in dealing with cancer would be very much appreciated. I am a cancer patient, and I am hoping to raise money for myself and my husband, Glen, because last week my medical team advised me to quit my job. I reluctantly followed their device; it left me and my husband in a lurch and caused us to need this GoFundMe. It will be used to pay bills, medical copays, food, gas, and other expenses covered by my work income. The problem is that I have become sick again. I caught a bad cold at work. I had been sick often since returning to work 7 months ago, after finishing my chemo and beginning a new life of immunotherapy treatment. I thought getting back to work and getting active would be good for me. I was wrong. I didn't fully realize what immunocompromised really meant. I also have trouble with side effects from my immunotherapy drugs, like nausea, chills, body aches, and other difficulties. I was thrilled whenever I completed an entire week of work. Glen and I need help because our social security cannot cover our expenses. Glen is doing what he can as a graphic artist, but at 77, he doesn't have many opportunities.

"Donate to Ease Lisa’s Journey with Breast Cancer","Hello! My name is Marlisa Perez-Moore. I am the daughter of this wonderful woman, Lisa Coates. I created this GoFundMe for my mother because of her recent diagnosis of Stage 3 Breast Cancer at 46 years old. Lisa’s journey started in early August 2025. The first to find out in our household was my stepfather, Dave Coates, then me, then my 10-year-old brother. Not many of our family members know about her diagnosis yet.

Lisa’s first month of chemotherapy has been a rollercoaster of a ride. The first thing Lisa was worried about was her hair, of course. I would be too if I had long curly hair like hers. She asked me to cut it one morning to try and save as much of it as she could. And that’s what we did; we took off around 9 inches that day. But sadly, chemo was not kind to her beautiful hair; it has already started to take away that once thick and precious hair. I will not lie, it is very heartbreaking to see her without her luscious curly hair. I never could have imagined having longer hair than my mother in a million years. I’d like to preserve the images of her having that once long and desirable curly hair, so that is what I used for her GoFundMe.","$1,240","4K","1 d ago","https://images.gofundme.com/rm40k_xWhNXzisuC1wcTChi3CT8=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/95232043_1759293190778818_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/donate-to-ease-lisas-journey-with-breast-cancer?qid=0c4e5984a8ee7a057dfd129d854cd733","Shelf, Shelving, Personal care, Retail, Customer, Plastic, Cleanliness"

"Help Shaena access potentially life-saving Cancer Treatment","Hi — my name is Shaena Crane. I’m 34 and a partner to Matt Trozzi and a cat-mom to Pidgey Pidgerton. I’ve been fighting BRCA-related triple negative breast cancer and have gone through multiple treatments and clinical trials. My medical team believes a specific medication could give me a real chance at meaningful response, but current coverage and eligibility limits make it inaccessible.

With compassionate pricing and partial support, my out-of-pocket cost would still be roughly $7,000/month just for the medication. These funds will go toward the drug itself, pharmacy fees, travel/clinic visits, and supportive care so I can continue to fight without immediate financial ruin.","$11,940","13K","3 d ago","https://images.gofundme.com/dvq3okLVOjxIU0hJIDE-GVZi9Qo=/720x405/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V0oBwUn09QQ/0.jpg","https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-shaena-access-potentially-lifesaving-cancer-treatment?qid=32fd28d65c9d2906df7b87ba92214e4a","Chin, Cheek, Eyebrow, Lips, Skin, Nose, Jaw, Mouth, Neck, Beauty"

Since going into hospital in August 2024, Alex and his young family have had such a tough time, and treatment is likely to continue for the next year and more. Constant hospital visits alongside Alex being really poorly has turned their lives upside down.

In true Char-fashion, she recently made the selfless decision to shift from full-time to part-time work and create space in her life and tiny home, so she can help her elderly mother relocate from Arizona to Maine and become her primary caregiver.

In April 2023, my life changed dramatically when I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer with carcinomatosis and metastasis. Since then, I’ve undergone eight major surgeries and endured five different chemotherapy treatments. The journey has been relentless, and I’ve barely been able to work since my diagnosis, using up all my savings just to keep up with basic living expenses.

For over 25 years, I’ve built a career as a tattoo artist, always striving to support my clients, fellow tattooers, artists, and people in need. Generosity and community have been at the heart of my work, and now I find myself needing help from others.

My family has been my anchor through this storm. My fiancé has put her own work on hold to support me through every treatment and hospital stay, and my children have continued their studies despite the emotional toll of seeing their father so ill. Right now, I’ve been in the hospital for over two weeks, facing new complications after having 17 feet of my small bowel removed due to an obstruction. I developed an intestinal abscess from an E. coli infection, which has caused severe pain and led to palliative measures. Despite all this, I am not ready to give up.

"Support for Ellen’s Cancer Recovery","My sister, Ellen, was recently diagnosed with Stage 2B high-grade serous carcinoma of the fallopian tubes, an aggressive form of ovarian cancer. After complaining of abdominal pain, Ellen was taken to the ER where they found a tumor on her right ovary. She was scheduled for surgery three days later to remove the tumor, ovaries and fallopian tubes. The organs and tumor were biopsied, and cancer was found in one of her fallopian tubes. A second surgery was required to remove all remaining reproductive organs. At that time, cancer was also found on her bladder and was removed. She is now undergoing a challenging course of chemotherapy which involves 6-hour infusion sessions every 3 weeks for 5 months. This will be followed by another 18 months of chemotherapy. The treatments are taking a serious toll on her body, leaving her exhausted and in daily pain, making it impossible for her to work. Ellen is a public servant working as a school bus driver for Effingham County, GA. She misses her daily drives with her students and is ready to get back to work. Unfortunately, she will not be able to return for at least a year. Her wife, Melanie, is also a public servant working for Chatham County, GA. Melanie continues to work full time, but the demands of caring for Ellen, managing the household, and supporting their 16-year-old daughter, Sydney, have become overwhelming. With Melanie running out of personal leave and Ellen needing extra help during each week of chemotherapy, their family is facing a critical time. Lost income and the need for additional support with housework, lawn care, and home maintenance have added to their stress. By coming together to support Ellen, Melanie, and Sydney, we can help ease their burden and allow them to focus on what matters most—Ellen’s recovery and their family’s well-being.

Dear friends, kind strangers, and compassionate supporters,

Just two weeks ago, I was living my dream—traveling with my wife and child, enjoying time together without a thought of hospitals or medical bills. Suddenly, our world changed. In the span of 48 hours, what started as a hiking injury turned into a devastating diagnosis: my spine fractured and collapsed from undetected cancer lesions.

My wife Carolina rushed to support me as I lost the ability to walk and felt every hour become a battle against pain.

In January, after what was supposed to be a routine appointment, our families’ world was turned upside down. Doctors discovered a mass on my sister‘s ovaries, which led to surgery. What they found was even more difficult. Three masses were removed, and after further testing cancer was also found in her small intestines and lymph nodes.
Since then, she has undergone multiple surgeries, treatments, and now receives ongoing injections to fight this disease. Despite her strength, the journey has been overwhelming. Recently, another spot was found in her pelvic area and she has been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer.
At 59 years old, my sister-in-law is facing the hardest battle of her life. The physical toll of cancer is immense, but so was the financial one.

I’m not one to ask for help; I’m usually the one offering my home or coming by to help anyone in need.

I’m asking for assistance with medical bills, accessories to help keep me comfortable through chemo and surgeries. Since my diagnosis, I’ve learned this cancer is more common in women under 40 and only affects 10-15% of women with breast cancer. This type spreads rapidly and can spread into your body in microscopic form. So far, I’ve had two ultrasound biopsies and one MRI biopsy. I will be starting 4 regimens of chemotherapy and immunotherapy for the next 24 weeks, followed by a double mastectomy surgery and two reconstructive surgeries.

Despite undergoing chemotherapy, constant doctor visits, and unimaginable challenges, she comes to work every day like clockwork, ready to greet her students and help them thrive.

She did manage to get her car back and her phone reconnected, but what's truly amazing through all of this is that she has never once asked for help.

Tammy Jo was recently diagnosed with a rare Stage 3 anal cancer.
While doctors say this cancer is treatable, the road ahead is long, painful, and exhausting. A diagnosis like this doesn’t just attack the body—it shakes the heart, the spirit, and the wallet.

In May 2025, Lacy accepted a job with a new employer only to find out a few days later she had breast cancer. Since she was new to the position, short-term disability and sick/vacation time were not available for her. Lacy decided to have a double mastectomy to battle the cancer in hoping not to have to deal with it again. Unfortunately, when Lacy had the procedure, they also removed some lymph nodes which turned out to be cancerous. Through her many appointments, chemo treatments (currently completed 2), and sickness from the treatments, she has missed quite a bit of work time which results in loss of income and her husband can’t work overtime due to helping Lacy at home. Although her insurance pays most of her health expenses, there is still the fact that bills exist, and this is an extra stressor for Lacy while going through this journey.

Brad and his family are now facing mounting hospital bills, daily parking fees for treatments, and many of the unexpected costs that come with a serious illness. On top of the emotional toll of his diagnosis, these expenses have made this season especially challenging.","$8,176","10K","3 d ago","https://images.gofundme.com/MUjYwHRAUsOeM3oslocUcL_Fgc8=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/95137083_1759162564198194_r.jpeg","https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-brad-dills-cancer-fight?qid=cfc13ba350bf9df7aed0477477452e52","Eyewear, Vision Care, Headgear, Orange, Cap, Smile, Facial hair, Goggles, Sunglasses, Baseball cap"

He is going into Hospice today.. so this gofundme is now unfortunately for funeral expenses. TY you all for supporting Ryan. Most of you know, my son, Ryan Perlaky was diagnosed with stage 4 advanced terminal Esophageal Cancer, at age 33. The treatment med he was on held the Cancer at bay for 4 1/2 years. Unfortunately the med stopped working and Ryan's Cancer came back hot and angry. Ryan tries to work, a few hours a week mowing grass if he can, but the pain is so bad at times he cant even do that, but he is no longer able to work full time, he applied for disability, but that can take up to 149 days. Ryan uses a cane, walker and for long distances a wheelchair. Ryan's Cancer is all over in his back, rib, bones and liver which causes him excruciating pain. He also has issues with his left leg. Since he can no longer work full time, we are asking for Donations to help with household bills, medication for him and his children, Erabella (12) and Alyssa (10). This is VERY hard for Ryan to ask for Donations, but at this time he really needs it. The Cancer started in his Esophagus then spread to his bones, brain, back, hip and liver. If you can find it in your heart ❤️ to donate any amount you can, it will be greatly appreciated. It would give him a piece of mind knowing that things are being taken care of, so he can stop stressing out and focus on getting better.

I had heard of https://sancturalife.com/. in Capetown South Africa but they suggested I’d come to their clinic in London because of my poor medical situation to avoid an 11 hour flight. I started my first GoFundMe and raised 55K. A lot of money but London was way more expensive and due to some hospitalisations, extra procedures and hickups we spent most of these funds. They managed to do miracles but I am not there yet and will proceed treatment in Capetown South Africa. The costs are way lower and with 40K we can do 6 months of treatments. Unfortunately, the treatments are not covered by insurance. The money I raise will be used to fund my treatment in Capetown.

What started as some abdominal pain and discomfort quickly turned into a devastating diagnosis. After weeks of tests and uncertainty, Sean was told he had stage 4 pancreatic cancer that had already spread to his liver, stomach, and lymph nodes.

On behalf of my sister, I’m reaching out for your support during one of the hardest moments of our lives.

Earlier this year, Ana-Lisa sought medical care for worsening chronic back pain. It had gotten so bad that walking became difficult, and working was nearly impossible.

"Support Riley’s Fight Against Cancer","Hi, I’m Riley Steiner. I was diagnosed with metastatic Ewing Sarcoma in May of 2022. I went through nine months of chemo and was in remission for a year. It came back in different spots, and I underwent more chemo and radiation, as well as multiple surgeries on my leg where the first tumor was. I was in remission again, and it came back recently. I had a small tumor in my pelvis and had head pain; they found two tumors in my skull. This cancer is very aggressive and very painful. I was offered to be comfortable and let it happen, but I decided I’m fighting until I can’t. So, I’ll be starting more radiation in my head and pelvis and a new chemo pill to hopefully stop any more from growing. I'm only 27 years old and have been dealing with pain and treatment for the last four years now. I’ve managed to remain positive and hopeful of a good outcome even tho it’s very unlikely. I'm asking for any donations, prayers, and support to help with medical bills, groceries, and really just anything to help me live my life how I would like to right now since I’ve been unable to work.

Come August, they found out they were pregnant and were so excited for this new chapter. In October, they found out something was wrong and opted to do genetic testing and a CVS procedure. Come November, they were told the heartbreaking news that both she and her husband were carriers of a genetic fatal disease that was confirmed to have affected the baby, and they had to say goodbye. After some time passed and due to the risk of this affecting future babies, they decided to pursue IVF.

After experiencing such a huge loss, Lex got tested for BRCA and found out she was BRCA1 positive and moved forward with getting biopsies and mammograms. It was then determined that she has triple-negative breast cancer. After receiving a double mastectomy and testing the breast tissue, the doctors went from thinking it was Stage 1 to Stage 3A breast cancer as it has spread to her lymph node. Lex has just recently started chemo and will have to undergo two different phases of chemotherapy, implant/expander exchange, radiation, and then immunotherapy.

The cancer originated in the female reproductive organs and has moved to the Peritoneum, which is the serous membrane that forms the lining of the abdominal cavity. Treatment is pretty straightforward at this time, with three rounds of chemotherapy to shrink the tumors so she can have surgery to remove the reproductive organs and as much cancer as possible. That will be followed by another three rounds of chemotherapy post-surgery that should bring her into remission. In layman’s terms, she is dealing with a cancer of the female reproductive organs that has moved to the abdominal cavity.","$5,855","9K","September 22nd, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/z_Dl6zrervxt-gHosVdqitey_08=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94883461_1759166858513242_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-join-tammy-walkups-battle-against-cancer?qid=0c4e5984a8ee7a057dfd129d854cd733","Eyewear, Smile, Sunglasses, Glasses, Vision Care, Happiness, Face, Nose, Goggles, Mouth"
"Stand with Gregg Reveles in His Fight Against Cancer","Support Gregg’s Fight Against Cancer

Hi friends,
We're reaching out on behalf of our dear friend and longtime teammate, Gregg Reveles, who was recently diagnosed with cancer. This news has come as a shock to all of us who know and love Gregg, someone who has given so much of himself to our team, our guests, and the craft beer community over the years.

Gregg has been a fixture in the Austin beer community, and a dedicated part of The Brewtorium family for over 7 years. Whether it’s staying late to help his coworkers, treating guests with warmth and patience, or simply being the person we all turn to when we need a smile, Gregg has always shown up with heart, kindness, and his unforgettably infectious laugh. He’s the kind of person who remembers your name, your favorite beer, and probably a story you told him six months ago.","$29,876","35K","July 18th, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/8zO0cXb17Hfbssj1Oc_gKWgNe8A=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/92799655_1752978569473639_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-with-gregg-reveles-in-his-fight-against-cancer?qid=78ccdfdafec166d0f8a67066d2e9e600","Facial hair, Beard, Moustache, Active Shirt, Sunglasses"
"Help with Annabelle’s Lung Cancer Vet Bills","I got Annabelle when she was just 2 weeks old. I was at the shelter looking for dogs to pull to take back to the rescue I worked for, when the shelter manager walked up to me and pulled a small kitten out of her pocket. She asked me to foster her and her litter, but I already knew she was mine. I bottle fed her and her brother Gizmo, and welcomed them into my family. I trained them, socialized them, and raised them to be amazing kittens. Annabelle has been my demo cat for many years, and taught many baby cat groomers how to groom.

Annabelle has been with me through everything, and she is 11 now. Still so young for a cat. But on Saturday night, everything changed. She was breathing weird and looked uncomfortable, so we took her to the Emergency Room. She had 100mL of fluid drained from her chest, and after lots of testing, she was just diagnosed on Sunday (9/21) with lung cancer. I just lost my job a few days before, and was forced to use our wedding fund to pay for her emergency vet bills. I don’t regret it one bit though, and I’d do it again. There is no party on earth that is more important than my little baby girl.","$2,100","2.4K","5 d ago","https://images.gofundme.com/WnBT906pQW87Jr_HPMuT6sSLuUo=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/95069969_175894185066290_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-with-annabelles-lung-cancer-vet-bills?qid=4f16241eb1fc2f0f06f4377fc6d558a3","Cat, Felidae, Whiskers, Felinae, Carnivores, Vertebrate, Snout, Fur, Collar, Terrestrial animal"

"Support Sophie Deslatte's Battle with Brain Cancer","Sophie Deslatte, Olivia's sister, was recently diagnosed with brain cancer in the form of an optic pathway glioma. This was found on a routine yearly eye exam. After she was examined by an ophthalmologist, she was immediately sent to Children's Medical Center ER in Dallas. They found the tumor on an MRI. It is in the optic nerve pathway, right where the left and right eye nerves meet in the middle of her brain. The tumor is already affecting her eyesight. Because of the location, it can not be biopsied, making it inoperable. After many follow up appointments, the oncologists agree that the best treatment for Sophie is radiation. She will be undergoing radiation for 5 days a week for 5 weeks. This means that they will have to stay in Dallas for 5 weeks. This also means 5 weeks of missed work and wages, while trying to cover living expenses while in Dallas. Treatment should start around the beginning of October. So many people have already been asking how they can help, so we decided to set up this Gofund.me to have an avenue open to help the Deslatte family.

"Help Erin fight Metastatic Breast Cancer at Hope4Cancer","In 2019, at just 39 years old, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. The journey that followed was incredibly hard — I became very sick and nearly lost my life. Through courage, faith, and God’s grace I fought my way back to health with my family by my side.

Sadly, in October 2024, I received devastating news: the cancer had returned as stage 4 metastatic breast cancer and had spread to my bones. Since then, I have tried numerous treatments — both holistic approaches and chemotherapy.

For a while, it seemed like the cancer was going away, but scans in August 2025 revealed that it had returned and was spreading to other areas.

"Support Cloe's Fight Against Breast Cancer","Hi everyone!

Mid-way through August, my best friend Cloe got some devastating and unexpected news: she has stage 2 breast cancer. Seeing as she is only 25 years old and otherwise completely healthy, this came totally out of left field and has turned her whole life upside down. Because of her age and other contributing factors, she was given an emergency referral to the BC Cancer Clinic and within just a couple of weeks she was already undergoing a partial mastectomy and beginning the fight of her life.

After her surgery, her doctors sent the tumour and other tissues to the lab to be tested and long story short, she will have to undergo chemotherapy and most likely subsequent radiation. Since Cloe is only 25 years old, before she can begin treatment she will need to go through the process of freezing her eggs. If she doesn't, all of the medications and procedures used to fight the cancer cells would most likely leave her infertile. This is where the fundraiser really comes into play. Even with the discounted rate that they give to cancer patients, Cloe still faces a $10-15,000.00 bill just for the medications, the retrieval and the freezing. That doesn't even include the yearly storage fee and the fees in the future when she undergoes the process of getting pregnant via IVF. It is my hope and goal that we can help Cloe raise the money she needs so she can focus on healing and fighting the cancer rather than stressing about money and making ends meet. Vancouver is such an expensive city as it is, let alone when you have to take extended periods of time off of work and have huge incoming costs looming over you.","$2,905","10K","2 d ago","https://images.gofundme.com/AgWs6_ExXDIe0fk7seJWMKbr1Z0=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/95187871_1759262979127326_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-cloes-fight-against-breast-cancer?qid=cfc13ba350bf9df7aed0477477452e52","Medical, Health Care, Hospital, Medical equipment, Patient, Room, Hospital bed, Comfort, Medical procedure, Bed"

"Help Jack rebuild his life post-cancer!","In putting together a bio for this, I’ve spent a lot of time agonizing over how much detail to get into. I never seriously imagined myself doing something like this in the first place, but I think if it ever did cross my mind, I pictured something that would be a lot easier to talk about openly. As objectively awful as it was, what actually happened to me this summer was also something that’s so weird and uncomfortable to talk about that I seriously considered never revealing the details to anyone outside my smallest innermost circle of family and friends. In the end I changed my mind precisely because of that discomfort and weirdness- it’s incredibly unlikely (about 1 in 100,000) that anyone else I know will ever end up in the same boat, but this year proved to me that it’s not impossible. It’s my hope that by talking about it openly I can make it a little less lonely for anyone else who might find themselves going through such a terrifying and painful ordeal, and to break the ice; to make it something that’s a little easier to talk about, both for the person going through it and for the people trying to be there for them.","$9,637","10K","September 19th, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/Ha-dydR0f_V-2IOP6NghfRYqq9g=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94814079_1758321378655626_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-jack-rebuild-his-life-postcancer?qid=78ccdfdafec166d0f8a67066d2e9e600","Camera, Baseball cap"

"Together for Jeris: Beating Stage 3 Ovarian Cancer","Dear Friends, Family and Kindhearted Strangers-

It’s hard to put into words the heartbreak of watching someone you love face what Jeris is going through right now. Just weeks after losing her mother, Jeris received the devastating news that she has stage 3c ovarian cancer that has already spread throughout her abdominal lining. As if that weren’t enough, her husband, Patrick, was laid off from his job in mid-September, adding another heavy layer of stress and uncertainty for their family.

Jeris is one of the strongest, most loving people we know. As a devoted wife and mother, her greatest wish is simple: to keep fighting with everything she has so she can continue being here for her husband, her children, and the family and friends who love her so deeply. She has already begun chemotherapy and is also under the care of a specialized oncologist pursuing advanced therapies that offer real hope for the best possible outcome. Unfortunately, many of the treatments most likely to make a difference in her long term survival, recurrence reduction, and quality of life are not covered by insurance.","$71,686","90K","September 19th, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/Bqcy73JZzEbkPnMqKUz94ujGnqc=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94802595_1758299530683925_r.JPEG","https://www.gofundme.com/f/together-for-jeris-beating-stage-3-ovarian-cancer?qid=3ab25b990d56125d05daa92ab02472bc","People, Clothing, Smile, Happiness, Formal wear, Dress, Trousers, Event, Interaction, One-piece garment"

"Donate to Retired HPD officers cancer surgery recovery.","Retired HPD Officer David Latigo in need of assistance.

Help My Dad Recover After a Life-Threatening Surgery
Hey everyone, I’m reaching out during one of the most difficult times our family has ever faced. Recently, my dad went into what we hoped would be a straightforward surgery to remove cancerous polyps. We were optimistic — he’s always been strong, and we believed this would be the first big step on his road to recovery.

 Unfortunately, things took a serious and unexpected turn during the procedure. Complications arose that none of us could have anticipated. At one point, he flatlined and had to be revived. He was immediately intubated and placed on life support, spending several harrowing days in the ICU, fighting for his life.

 By some miracle, he is now stable and beginning the long road to recovery. But the journey ahead won’t be easy. He faces a slow, challenging recovery — one that includes ongoing medical care, physical therapy, and mounting hospital bills. We’ve created this GoFundMe to ask for your help. Every donation, no matter the size, will go directly toward:
 • Covering the cost of his extended hospital stay
 • Follow-up appointments, medications, and rehabilitation
 • Helping to make up for lost income while he is unable to work

 My dad has always been a generous and selfless person — the kind of man who would give you the shirt off his back. He has quietly supported so many family members, friends, and even strangers over the years. Now, he’s the one who needs support, and we’re humbly asking for help on his behalf.

 As a retired member of the Houston Police Department, my dad spent his career serving and protecting others. His HPD family has always been close-knit, and we’re already seeing them begin to rally around him like they always do for a brother in blue. That unwavering support — along with help from friends, family, and our wider community — means more than we can ever express.

 Your prayers, kind words, and any support you can offer mean the world to us right now. Thank you for taking the time to read, and for being part of our community during this incredibly difficult time. We’re holding onto hope, and with your help, we believe brighter days are ahead.

 With heartfelt gratitude,

"Tom Meismer’s Continuing Brain Cancer Fight","Tom Meismer, my nephew, is one of the most resilient and determined people I know. Diagnosed with brain cancer in January 2023, Tom initially had brain surgery to remove most of the tumor, then underwent chemotherapy, and did go into remission. However, a follow-up MRI in May 2025 revealed the tumor was again growing. He was fortunate to be admitted to a clinical study at Northwestern Hospital in Chicago, where he’s undergoing both chemotherapy and an experimental drug regimen. The treatments are tough—chemo leaves him exhausted for days—but continuing MRI results have given us hope.

Tom and his wife, Kendra, are doing everything they can to keep life as normal as possible for their two young children. While the clinical study covers some costs, there are still significant expenses for travel, time off work, and daily living. Tom’s commitment to his family is unwavering, but the financial strain is growing. Mortgage payments, student loans, car loans, preschool, and the costs of raising two small children all add up, especially as Tom faces the possibility of unpaid leave as the year ends.

Even in the midst of treatment, Tom continues to raise funds for astrocytoma research, leading this year’s team—the “Astrocytoma Assassins”—with his trademark humor and determination. Our family and friends have rallied around Tom, but we need help to ensure he can focus on healing and supporting his family.

Helen Moraca (Matthews) was recently diagnosed with stage 3 cervical cancer.

Before her diagnosis, Helen was a hard-working mother who juggled multiple jobs to support her family and three beautiful daughters. Unfortunately, due to the intensity of her chemotherapy and radiation treatments, she has been forced to cut her hours and slow down.

Helen is someone who has always gone above and beyond to help others — now she needs our help. This GoFundMe has been set up to assist with medical expenses, treatment costs, and daily living needs while she focuses on healing.

Fortunately now his pain is being managed through Brown Cancer Center and he will be starting treatments ASAP, likely next week.

His care team is floored how someone his age even has this cancer, but they have been very optimistic about this being treatable and even curable.

"Help Liberty fund her cancer treatment & get a car!","Liberty is just 21 years old, and for the last 3 years she has been courageously battling an aggressive form of leukemia. To survive, she sells candies on the streets to help cover the overwhelming cost of her cancer treatments. But despite her strength and determination, her family is barely making ends meet. Many days they struggle to put food on the table, let alone cover the cost of lifesaving care.

Her biggest dream is to continue her treatments without the constant fear of how to pay for them—and to have a reliable car. Right now, Liberty and her family must take public transportation and travel over 3 hours each way to the hospital. A car would not only ease their daily struggles but would bring them hope, freedom, and the chance for Liberty to focus fully on healing.

No family should have to choose between groceries and cancer treatment. Every donation, big or small, will directly help Liberty continue her fight for life and bring her one step closer to her dream.","$70,221","72K","September 2nd, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/CbRynihQzefpicRZy08s-4s9mAU=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94263167_1756868794115031_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-liberty-fund-her-cancer-treatment-dream-of-a-car?qid=1e68b82ef99df1ad57dd551fd74d23a9","Eyewear, Head, Glasses, Happiness, Vision Care, Temple, Eye, Summer, Ear, Fun"

I first met Abby growing up playing OMGHA hockey and attending Saint Vincent de Paul church. Anyone who knows her knows that Abby lights up every room she walks into.

After graduating in 2021, Abby followed in her parents’ and sister’s footsteps at the University of Wisconsin–Stout.

Together, they are raising two wonderful children, Beau (12) and Audrey (10). Raelynn is a beloved public school teacher, and Alex, retired after 24 years in the navy, now works as a cyber security professional. They are truly two of the most lovely, energetic, optimistic, and generous people imaginable. Their friends and neighbors are still reeling from the news that in March of 2025, Alex was diagnosed with Stage IV mucosal melanoma.

We are deeply grateful for the outpouring of love, support, donations, and prayers during this incredibly difficult time. Please continue to keep our family in your thoughts and prayers as we navigate this unimaginable loss. Keontae celebrated his 4th birthday on September 6, 2023. Shortly after, he was diagnosed with Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma — a rare and aggressive cancer that develops from immature muscle cells. His diagnosis was classified as Stage 4, Group 4, with tumors found on his spine, skull, and prostate. Keontae began his chemotherapy and radiation treatments on September 29, 2023, embarking on a rigorous 54-week journey. He bravely completed his treatments on August 27, 2024, enduring multiple rounds of radiation and ringing the bell three separate times — a symbol of his strength and courage. Sadly, in May 2025, we received devastating news that the cancer had returned — more aggressive than ever. In just a few months and without further treatment options, it progressed rapidly.

 A message from Mom and Dad: “We want to thank everyone who has prayed for us. Your support means more than words can express. Our world was shattered the day we heard the words, ‘Your child has cancer.’ Keontae was only 4 years old. Those words were the most painful and crushing we’ve ever heard.

Organized with love by her brother, cousin, and lifelong friends

Dear friends, family, and all who believe in the power of community: We’re reaching out with full hearts and deep love for someone incredibly special to us — our sister, cousin, and dear friend Shannon, who is facing an unimaginable challenge with courage and grace. She’s recently been diagnosed with Triple Negative, High-Grade Spindle Cell Carcinoma — a rare and fiercely aggressive form of breast cancer that affects fewer than 1% of patients. As Shannon begins this intense journey through treatment, Robi has made the heartfelt decision to step away from work so he can be fully present for her. We often assume that insurance will cover the cost of care, but the truth is, so much of what’s needed — from specialist visits to medications and supportive therapies — isn’t covered. On top of that, there are still the regular rhythms of life to maintain. That’s why we’ve created this space — not out of desperation, but out of love. We know that many people want to help, and this is one meaningful way to do just that. Any support, no matter the size, will help lighten their load and give Shannon and her family the breathing room to focus on what matters most: healing, hope, and holding each other close.","$10,729","11K","August 11th, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/zMSRzALCdFR4-cADPt0sI2s-DRs=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93555953_1754940553486893_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/standing-with-shannon-in-her-fight-against-cancer?qid=a57ed1c51057f1e7bd6c977de73fde26","Facial hair, Moustache, Beard, Selfie, Love"

"“Supporting Josh Lyons During His Cancer Fight”","Hello — my name is Donna, and I’m a close friend of Josh Lyons. I’m reaching out today on his behalf because he is courageously battling stage 3 throat cancer.
Josh’s treatment is already placing an immense burden on him — physically, emotionally, and financially. Because of the severity of his condition, the tumor has impacted his jaw, making it extremely difficult for him to speak. He simply cannot return to work for at least six months, which means no steady income during that time.
To make matters more difficult, his employer was kind enough to cover his pay through this month — but beyond that, he will not be compensated. And while he was out, his health insurance was temporarily dropped, so he has had to secure new coverage at a time he can least afford it. Medical costs, living expenses, and insurance bills are stacking up fast.","$1,430","5.5K","7 hrs ago","https://images.gofundme.com/5muDuAN072qLuSiaQSg9aRAJbrk=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/95261803_1759362370840510_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-josh-lyons-during-his-cancer-fight?qid=78ccdfdafec166d0f8a67066d2e9e600","Medical"

Our family wanted to raise some awareness and support for my beautiful sister-in-law Carly and her family, Fraser and Willow. At 19 weeks pregnant with her first child, Carly experienced a focal seizure. This was completely out of the blue and shocking to say the least. She was taken to hospital and an MRI brain discovered a lesion in her right parietal lobe. As Carly was pregnant, there were not any invasive testing options available so she was placed on anti-seizure medications and asked to wait until delivery as the lesion at that time appeared stable.

Her symptoms began to develop at 30 weeks pregnant including auditory hallucinations and persistent seizures. She was advised by a team of specialists to deliver the baby early at 32 weeks gestation to enable more invasive testing for Carly. Willow was delivered a healthy pre-term baby at 32 weeks and 1 day and after several weeks in the NICU she is home and thriving. The day after Willow was delivered Carly had an MRI brain scan with contrast which showed an aggressive high grade glioma.","$81,355","90K","September 1st, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/S-pjggYbU2wGoYbdY_39bTtth5k=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94194785_1756724298425311_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/carly-and-her-family-get-through-brain-cancer-treatment?qid=f55aae06bcc7decfe7790cdbf596add9","People, Dog, Smile, Happiness, Carnivores, Love, Comfort, Family, Child, Family pictures"

Hi, my name is Seabrey and I’m fundraising for my sister, Shayna.

A few years ago, Shayna was diagnosed with melanoma. She went through surgery to remove the mole and her lymph nodes, and we were all so hopeful that the cancer was behind her. Recently, however, our lives turned upside down.

She suddenly began experiencing weakness on her right side and trouble speaking. After rushing her to the hospital, doctors discovered a mass on her brain, which was confirmed to be melanoma that had spread.

"Support Doug & Joleen’s Cancer Fight","Doug and Joleen from northern Minnesota have always been there for their family and friends. Doug, a dedicated worker at Westmor Industries until injuries forced him into retirement, is known for his love of classic cars—especially his prized Chevy Nova. Together, Doug and Joleen have built a close-knit family with their two children, Nick and Jess, and three grandchildren, Alexis, Emma, and Lucy. Their home is filled with love, laughter, and a deep commitment to supporting those around them.

Recently, Doug faced a life-threatening emergency when he woke up unable to breathe and was life-flighted to Mayo Hospital. There, he was diagnosed with extremely rare tracheal cancer and underwent a complex, 10-hour surgery to remove the tumor. The recovery has been long and difficult, involving a tracheostomy, ventilator support, and weeks in the hospital on IV nutrition. Doug now faces additional radiation and treatments at Mayo, requiring frequent and extended trips—each one a six-hour journey from home. The financial strain of travel, hotel stays, and ongoing care has been overwhelming, especially as insurance has denied coverage for much of the treatment.

Doug and Joleen are both retired and living on a fixed income. The mounting medical bills and the prospect of weeks away from home for radiation have left them in a difficult position. Support from friends, family, and the community would mean everything to them. It would allow Doug and Joleen to focus on his recovery and healing, both physically and mentally, without the constant worry of how to afford the care he needs.

"Support for Dan’s Battle with Cancer","Hi friends, family, and compassionate strangers —

This past week has turned our family’s world upside down. What began as a routine pre-surgery CT scan for a hernia has resulted in a life-altering and devastating diagnosis for my brother-in-law, Dan. Instead of prepping for minor surgery, he’s now facing an aggressive battle with testicular cancer that has already spread to his lungs and abdomen.

Dan is not just a patient — he is a devoted husband, brother, son, loving father, and proud grandfather. This diagnosis came out of nowhere, and the need for support — emotionally, physically, and financially — has escalated at an overwhelming pace. We only learned about the seriousness of his condition within the last week. Since then, his mobility is already limited, requiring immediate purchases of critical medical supplies.","$10,246","25K","August 1st, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/VhpEvFrIpXcazC3sPFoGZbMLkdM=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93273013_1755317177928776_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-for-dans-battle-with-cancer?qid=3ab25b990d56125d05daa92ab02472bc","Medical, Tooth, Hospital, Medical equipment, Health Care, Patient, Clinic, Health Professional, Medical procedure"

I felt that standard care would be too strong for my body so I researched integrative clinics across the country and decided on one in Florida. My treatments included IPT (insulin potentiation therapy) which is low dose (25%) chemo, herbal IV’s, off label pharmaceuticals, and more. The cancer shrunk significantly in 3 months! At the same time, I was suffering from anemia and I had a growth on my ovary that the doctors were watching via ultrasound. But because I’m BRCA2 positive I had a high risk it could turn into ovarian cancer. Since the breast cancer was smaller and stable it was advised I have a total hysterectomy with ovary removal. I agreed. I had the surgery in May 2025.

For 23 years, my husband Andy has proudly served our community as a firefighter and paramedic and most recently, Lieutenant and paramedic. On August 21, 2023—just one week after our wedding day—he was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer. What should have been the happiest time of our lives suddenly became the fight of his life. Since then, Andy has endured 12 rounds of FOLFOX chemotherapy, each one taking a toll on both his body and his spirit.

On August 8, 2025, Andy underwent an emergency colon bypass surgery that saved his life. Only weeks later, on September 10, he began yet another grueling round of chemotherapy. While he continues down this conventional path, we know he needs more than chemo alone to fight this disease.","$104,388","150K","September 16th, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/kGlFRsKAPkB0XnHFhBpzxDf3BHQ=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94709659_175806061985750_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/andys-fight-against-stage-4-colon-cancer?qid=3ab25b990d56125d05daa92ab02472bc","Uniform, Military Person, Collar, Formal wear, Military uniform, Peaked cap, Military Officer, White-collar worker, Dress shirt, Pocket"

In the weeks leading up to this, Addie had complained of knee pain. While on a family vacation, a bruise appeared, so her parents took her in for an X-ray. That image raised concern, and she was scheduled for an MRI the following week. But in God’s kindness, a close friend who is a radiologist was able to get her an MRI the same day.

I’m starting this GoFundMe on behalf of my brother, Richard LaRosa. Many of you know him as someone who has always lived with humor, curiosity, and resilience. Right now, he’s facing the most intense challenge of his life: a recent diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer.

In May of 2025, Richard began experiencing serious urinary problems that led to a trip to the ER, long-term catheterizations, multiple doctor visits and tests, and eventually surgery. What doctors first thought was a 5.6 cm abscess turned out to be something far more serious. On September 3, he underwent a TURP surgery, and the biopsy confirmed prostate cancer, graded at Gleason 9. While the severity of the cancer has not yet been fully determined, based on his daily pain level, we suspect it may already involve surrounding structures. Richard is now preparing for further imaging in the coming weeks to determine his prognosis and the next steps of treatment.","$6,904","10K","3 d ago","https://images.gofundme.com/k3ncLl0REqJzvaPcThUUbcUD1Fg=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/95116829_1759095810491448_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-richard-larosas-fight-against-cancer?qid=cfc13ba350bf9df7aed0477477452e52","Chin, Cheek, Eyebrow, Forehead, Skin, Jaw, Wrinkle, Neck, Facial hair, Facial expression"

I wanted to share Michelle’s story. About two months ago, Hazel and her mommy were playing, and Hazel headbutted Michelle’s chest. Thank God she did. Michelle had a lump as big as a golf ball. She called the doctor the next Monday, and when she finally got in, it had shrunk and moved underneath her breast. Because of her age (29), they opted to do an ultrasound. The lump is 2 cm in diameter. She had a mammogram today showing no other lumps on the left side. Praise God. We will know more after her MRI on what stage it is. She now has a port to start chemo.

Magnolia will be undergoing surgery on Thursday, October 2nd, to remove the tumor along with her right kidney and have a port placed to prepare for chemotherapy. The care team will then test the tumor to determine the plan for chemotherapy. Magnolia will remain in the hospital for about a week after surgery, followed by continued healing at home for the long road ahead.

He has been the best father to me and my siblings, and the best husband to my mother. He has always been our greatest source of strength, and now he needs me by his side as he begins treatment for leukemia in Spain. There is no question in my mind that I need to be there for him, and I need to be there immediately.

The largest and most urgent cost is bringing my dog with me. My little 10-year-old pittie is my family, my emotional support, and my companion through every challenge I’ve faced. Because of her breed and her age, she cannot travel in cargo and is not allowed in the cabin on commercial flights.

She raised her daughter as a single mom, carrying herself through life’s hardships with her head high, always putting her family and friends first.

Less than a month ago, after what was supposed to be a routine one-year post-op check-up, Elena received devastating news: the tumour is back, and it's a stage 2 this time. She was rushed into surgery and is currently hospitalised, surrounded by an incredible team of doctors.

Elena will put up the fight of her life, with all the strength and determination that define her. But as anyone who’s faced this battle knows, cancer doesn’t just take a toll on the body—it takes a toll financially too.

"Ride for Resilience (R4R): Biking for Cancer and Communities","In March 2024, shortly after I retired and planned to travel, I began a different journey. I was diagnosed with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As a lifelong non-smoker, the news was shocking. An MRI for back pain revealed the cancer had spread to my spine, pelvis, liver, lymph nodes in my neck, and fractured several ribs.

Today, I am grateful to say I am among the small fraction of NSCLC patients who have No Evidence of Disease (NED). Thanks to a rare biomarker—an EGFR mutation called Exon 19 deletion—I’ve been able to receive a targeted therapy, Tagrisso, developed by AstraZeneca.

I consider myself fortunate, yet many lung cancer patients still lack access to or knowledge of critical biomarker testing that could extend their lives. My battle isn’t over.

My mom is a hard working PSW, as well as a mom to me and my 3 siblings and a wonderful grandma to my 3 boys. As many of you already know, my mom received the news that no woman wants to hear. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in April 2025. At this point, the tumour was quite large and the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes in her side and armpit. She quickly had to stop working as she underwent a double mastectomy in May. Since then, her body has been recovering from this major surgery and 6 weeks ago she started her aggressive chemotherapy journey, which will last until late December. Following this, she will undergo radiation treatment. With employment insurance only covering her for 26 weeks (that she has used up already) and no short-term disability, her source of income has decreased significantly, while the bills don't stop coming in. She has been told there is no other paths of income within the government that can be of assistance to her. With the loss of her mother earlier in the year and the diagnosis coming shortly after, it has been a hard year for the family. She also has two teenage children that live at home with her who she supports.

Milo is our sweet, gentle, and loving 7-year-old Boxer. He’s not just a pet he’s a true member of our family. Sadly, Milo has been diagnosed with a mastocytoma (mast cell tumor) on his leg. Over the past little while, the tumor has grown aggressively, and he now urgently needs surgery to remove it.
The main treatment is surgical removal with wide margins, which gives him the best chance of living a longer, pain-free life. Depending on the results, our vet may also recommend additional treatments like radiation, chemotherapy, or supportive medications. Milo will also need regular follow-up checks, since dogs with mast cell tumors can sometimes develop more in the future.

It strikes less than 400 people per year, is extremely aggressive and is life-threatening. The life expectancy data is not perfect, because the cancer is rare.

(English version – scroll down for Español & Français)

I wanted to share some very difficult news: my mom, Delfina, has been diagnosed with ovarian and colon cancer (high-grade serous carcinoma). Three weeks ago, she underwent emergency surgery, during which part of the tumor was removed. She is now recovering, and in about three weeks she will begin chemotherapy, which is urgently needed given the aggressive nature of this cancer.

My mom lives in Caracas, and my family has already spent over $30,000 on medical expenses, as healthcare in Venezuela is extremely costly.

In the weeks that followed, further testing — including biopsies and PET scans — revealed that the cancer had spread to her spine, resulting in a diagnosis of Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer.

To say we’re devastated is an understatement. Karoline has so much life left to live, and the thought of that being cut short is simply unimaginable. She has spent her life caring for others — both in her work as an ER nurse, and in the way she shows up for the people around her. She’s the first to check in when someone is struggling, always remembering to send a thoughtful card or a kind message. She's the friend who’s always up for a drink, a dinner, or just being there — a steady, loyal presence in our lives for more than 25 years. We cannot imagine this world without her. We won’t.","$118,200","120K","July 24th, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/quqfJEPbRPTTK1HXX-e8zQx_Mho=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93023847_1753404958555565_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-help-karoline-in-her-fight-against-cancer?qid=154b3d53e58c4236c4880fad882a3a0a","Smile, Flag of the United States, Happiness, Facial expression, Tooth, Flag, Blond, Brown hair, Long hair, Flag Day"
"Relieve Chierici family during Alan’s cancer battle","My name is Steph. I’m creating this GoFundMe for my sister and her husband as he is battling cancer.

The Chierici family received devastating news on April 7, 2025. Alan was diagnosed with stage 2/3 colon cancer. Anyone who knows this family knows that they won’t let this stop them. For the past five months, they have been battling silently, hoping for a straightforward path to recovery; however, they are barely in the middle of this journey. Alan just finished his last round of chemotherapy at the end of August, and they are now starting to feel the financial strain. Alan had scans this past week, and it shows the cancer has not grown, but sadly, it has not shrunk either. Alan is set to enter the next phase of treatment, which is a radiation/chemotherapy combination. If all goes well with this third phase, he will be eligible for the final phase: surgery. God willing, he will be able to have it by February of next year and start his remission.","$6,320","8K","6 d ago","https://images.gofundme.com/2qmyG0N3nWvMeI_ZpTVhoT3cRu4=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/95019067_1758836808787590_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/relieve-chierici-family-during-alans-cancer-battle?qid=0c4e5984a8ee7a057dfd129d854cd733","People, Happiness, Face, Smile, T-shirt, Shirt, Child, Family, Friendship, Fun"

Just after her 42nd birthday, Joanna was diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer which has spread to her liver.

Back in April 2025 I went for a routine colonoscopy for my Ulcerative Colitis. I have had this for around 15 years. During the procedure, my doctor came across a strange looking mass. This was the start of a 3 month roller coaster. I had multiple biopsies taken, tests, another colonoscopy and even more biopsies. My histology done at the hospital was inconclusive of cancer, even though the 8cm mass looked and acted like it. Eventually it was sent over to The Christie's for a second opinion.

Tara had left her full time job in the spring to spend more time with her daughter this summer, taking a role that would start part time and switch to full time this fall.

Because of thousands of incredible people, the biggest weight has been lifted: my cancer treatment is covered. That’s a miracle I never take for granted.","$246,614","300K","April 29th, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/5XAmtj9jDbWEGgLJMG5xEiWDjfM=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/90683213_1759112209577960_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-demisha-heal-from-stage-3-thyroid-cancer?qid=1e68b82ef99df1ad57dd551fd74d23a9","Eyewear, Glasses, Vision Care, Health Care, Medical, Hospital, Medical equipment, Patient, Hospital gown, Hospital bed"

For those of you wondering, we now have transferred Chelsea to a hospice house as of 9/29 not far from her home. She is surrounded by so much love, peace and beauty here.

We aren’t sure if she has days or weeks, but what we do know is she is SO loved through all of this.

She struggles to communicate and what she is able to speak is mostly mumbling that’s incredibly difficult to understand for all of us. She is bedridden at this time.

I'm asking for help for my dad to navigate this difficult time, and considering they are both retired, this is a huge financial strain. The money would be used for bills and anything to keep my mother comfortable. Then we also have prepared a cremation. Even if you cannot donate anything, your prayers are enough.

"Help Baby Gabriela Fight Liver Cancer","Gabriela was born on Saturday, September 20, 2025 — a beautiful baby girl welcomed with so much love. Just four days old, Gabriela has already been diagnosed with liver cancer, beginning a battle no newborn should ever have to face. Her family is now relocating to Boston Children’s Hospital so she can receive the specialized care and treatment she urgently needs.

While the Fisher House is generously providing housing during her stay, the family is facing overwhelming emotional and financial challenges — especially with time away from work and the continued need to cover rent and living expenses back home. Gabriela’s mom, Carly, is doing everything she can to stay strong — not only for Gabriela, but also for her two-year-old big sister, Gisele. Carly is still recovering from childbirth and is currently in a wheelchair due to a separated pelvis, making this already difficult situation even more painful and complex. She’s also navigating this without the support of her own parents, having lost both her mother and father. Thankfully, Carly has support from her husband, Corey — an Air Force veteran — who has been by Gabriela’s side at the hospital while Carly remains focused on healing and caring for Gisele. Together, they’re doing everything they can to keep their family strong during this unimaginable time — but they need help.

We are raising funds to support Gabriela and her family during this critical time. Donations will go directly toward rent and essential bills while the family is away from home, daily living expenses during treatment, medical costs not covered by insurance, travel to and from appointments, and support for Carly and Corey as they care for both of their young daughters. Every little bit helps — whether it’s a donation, a share, or a prayer. Gabriela is a tiny fighter, and with your help, she won’t fight alone — and neither will Carly, Corey, or Gisele.

For many years, our dad has battled the ups and downs of an autoimmune disease: Crohn’s. Over the past year, his health has declined significantly. He believed he was experiencing a flare-up and possibly coming out of remission. He began losing a concerning amount of weight, and this week he was finally able to undergo a colonoscopy.

On Thursday, 8/28, the colonoscopy revealed two large masses that were likely malignant and were biopsied. It also confirmed that he has both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. The following day, Friday 8/29, a CT scan thankfully showed that the likely cancerous masses have not spread beyond the colon. Of the two masses biopsied, only one has been confirmed as cancerous so far.","$34,480","50K","August 30th, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/-1ZJhJUqFDuGcz0aX0tGAYush8s=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94146081_1756578613591987_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-our-beloved-dad-papa-fight-cancer?qid=cba6fbc2647bb19b8a8333990df541bd","People, Clothing, Smile, Hair, Happiness, Head, Face, Arm, Hand, T-shirt"

I’ve always been a family man, deeply involved in our community and church, and I’ve tried to give back as much as I’ve received. My faith is central to my life, and I’ve leaned on it even more since receiving a sudden diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. This news has been a shock to me and my loved ones, especially after losing my father to cancer just nine months ago. I’m determined to fight this disease with everything I have, not just for myself, but for my family, friends, and everyone who has supported me.


After consulting with my oncologists and considering traditional chemotherapy, I began searching for non-toxic treatment options. My brother introduced me to Dr. Antonio Jimenez and the Hope4Cancer Treatment Center, which uses a holistic approach to healing. Their therapies focus on treating the whole person, not just the cancer, and they have helped thousands of people from around the world. I truly believe this is my best chance for a full recovery. The treatment is intensive, requiring me to stay at their facility for several weeks and undergo daily therapies. The cost is significant, and while my family and I have managed to gather some funds, we need help to cover the remaining expenses.


This journey has changed every aspect of my life. I’ve had to adjust my diet, work from home, and undergo procedures to prepare for treatment. The emotional toll is real, but my faith gives me peace and strength. My greatest concern is for my wife and children, and I want to do everything possible to be here for them. I’m asking for support from my community to help me reach Hope4Cancer and give myself the best chance at healing.

In the spring of 2023, the specialist's office contacted us, promising a call in July to schedule an appointment for discussing the results. However, after numerous phone calls and visits, we were told that there was no referral on file for Alex.

"Baby Josie has Cancer.","I am the great aunt to sweet little Josie. Her mother is my sister‘s daughter. Josie is an almost 2 year old happy and active little girl. She has a 3 & 1/2 year old sister and a little almost 3 month old baby brother. Josie’s dad is staying home with her brother and sister. Her mom and my sister are living at the hospital with Josie.

The most devastating words a parent could ever hear: “Your child has cancer.”

A few weeks ago, Josie woke up with a complete loss of balance and coordination. She was stumbling and falling everywhere and we couldn’t figure out why. She was completely fine otherwise and had no other symptoms or issues. I took her to urgent care knowing something wasn’t right and they said she likely had a bit of fluid in her ears that would drain on its own. The next day, she couldn’t even stand. Since we were at the beach, we drove her to Maynard Children’s Hospital in Greenville. After a normal CT scan of her head and normal bloodwork, we left with a diagnosis of “cerebellitis” potentially caused by a virus. They said it would likely go away on its own and we planned to do a head MRI outpatient. After a normal MRI, and no leads from the pediatrician, we decided to change course and take her Duke Children’s and I’m SO glad we did. They wanted to do another head MRI, but this time, with contrast and also a lumbar puncture; both of which came back normal. As sort of a last ditch effort for answers, the neurologist said “Let’s just do a CT scan of her whole body to make sure we’re not missing anything.” What they found changed everything. The CT scan revealed a neuroblastoma tumor next to her spine. My heart sank and a thousand questions ran through my mind. By doing more imaging, testing, and meetings everyday with countless specialty doctors, we discovered how many reasons we still have to be thankful. Josie’s tumor has caused her to develop a syndrome called opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia. The syndrome attacks the cerebellum, which explains her loss of balance and coordination, and only 2-4% of children with neuroblastoma tumors develop it. The obvious signs of this syndrome led us to pursuing testing so the tumor could be found. Many cases of neuroblastoma without the syndrome go undiagnosed for months, meanwhile the tumor continues to grow and spread. The tumor is also localized, does not invade her spinal cord, and does not cross the midline of her spine which is all great news for surgery. All the tests and imaging thus far suggest the cancer hasn’t spread, but we don’t know for sure until another scan is completed this Friday. As long as all is good, the surgeons will simply remove the tumor as a whole and chemo will not be necessary! We ask for your prayers that this will be the case as this would be best case scenario. Surgery will likely happen October 1st and she will require PT and OT therapy after recovery to help her regain strength and balance. The past few weeks have been an absolute whirlwind, but we are so thankful for Josie’s amazing doctors and nurses at Duke for advocating for her and not giving up on finding answers. We realize many kids in her shoes have a much worse journey and outcome.

My name is Sam Ledzianowski, and as some of you may know, my dad, Ron, was diagnosed with Stage 4 small cell lung cancer with metastases to the liver and bones on March 18th of this year. We went to the ER on March 16th thinking it was a bout of pneumonia and left with the worst-case scenario and a terrifying prognosis.

Small cell lung cancer is one of the most aggressive types of cancer a person can have. It responds well to treatment at first and then sneaks back in quickly and with a vengeance. The median survival rate is 12-18 months after diagnosis, 3-6 months if we didn’t do treatment.","$3,120","4K","2 d ago","https://images.gofundme.com/d-XxsTaQBc8PKNKzNYk8Mfw9Fd8=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/95127707_1759128721558147_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-rons-journey-through-stage-iv-cancer?qid=cfc13ba350bf9df7aed0477477452e52","Face, T-shirt, Smile, Beard, Facial hair, Fun, Active Shirt, Moustache, Denim, Happiness"

In August, Amanda had brain surgery to remove a tumor. The pathology came back showing it is an aggressive grade 3 brain cancer (oligodendroglioma).
On September 22nd she began daily radiation treatments, Monday through Friday, which will last for 6 weeks. Which will be followed by Chemotherapy. She will be having a port put in place, and will be on two chemotherapy medications, one through the port and two oral pills. The oral medication comes with a very high co-pay which adds another layer of financial stress during an already challenging time.

"Felicia’s Battle With Stage 4 Lung Cancer and LFS","So as most of you know my sister has been battling stage 4 lung cancer the last year and before that breast cancer amongst other things from a rare genetic disorder Li Fraumeni Syndrome that she was born with that keeps on giving her these terrible diseases. She has gone through so many surgeries and treatments the last 2 years. She finished intravenous chemo last summer and has been taking a daily chemo pill since then. We have had some ups and downs the entire year with her health. The last week and a half she’s been very sick due to some bacterial and viral infections she has not been feeling well at all. She’s been having trouble walking, swallowing, breathing and in the most severe pain she’s ever experienced. We found out last week as well her tumor markers were elevated and she needed a pet scan again. The insurance company denied it and said it “wasn’t medically necessary” so on Thursday she had to pay 2100 dollars out of pocket to get the scan because she knew something was wrong. Thank god she did because they found a mass on her l5 that’s has doubled in size the last 5 months.. she’s had this spot there and has had issues with pain and her legs and when she went 5 months ago and had other scans and saw multiple doctors they chalked it up to being a “stress fracture” when clearly that’s not the case. With her genetic disorder they should have biopsied it just like the other times they told her it was nothing but ended up being cancer. She has been screwed over terribly by our health care in this country time and time again. She has had non stop scans and appointments and this week is no different yesterday she had a brain mri and tomorrow she will have a lumbar mri and they will be doing a bone biopsy this week to see exactly what cancer we are dealing with they think more then likely it’s metastasis from her lungs. From what we know now she will be doing cyberknife radiation which she’s never had before and an even more aggressive chemo with a lot more side affects then last time. And on top of this she is already sick. She’s lost weight and is just genuinely doing unwell. We are going to look into a home health aid as well but don’t know if insurance will cover that let alone these new treatments. We don’t have many people who can come and help her but those who are also have children and work etc just like her you all know she is a amazing mother to a 11 year old little boy he’s not aware of the extent of anything yet. He just started middle school which is already a huge change. We just need all the help we can get to make sure the two of them can get through this. She is a warrior and hasn’t given up and we can’t give up on them either she has so much more life to live. No one deserves this.

"Help The Orwig's Fight Cancer","Anyone who knows Charlie knows that he's no stranger to back pain. He's previously had a lumbar surgery but for the past year the pain has been radiating up his back. Through many unconstructive doctors appointments Charlie has pushed through the pain. He finally demanded to see his spine doctor who ordered a new mri. August 27th was just like any other day. We went out and drove posts on a fencing job before Charlie went back to the doctors. He was laying on the table about to get an injection in his spine when the nurse stopped the procedure and told Charlie he needed to go talk to the doctor in his office. He told Charlie that he reviewed his MRI and that he needed to go to the hospital immediately and we have been here since. Our whole world has been turned upside down. Charlie has been diagnosed with uncureable stage 4 non small cell lung cancer which has spread from his lung to his spine. A tumor pushing on his spine fractured his C7 vertibre. While we have been in the hospital his T2 has fractured. September 10th Charlie had an emergency spinal fusion because his nerves were being compressed and he was loosing feeling and mobility in his legs and arms. The doctors were worried that if it continued Charlie could have become permanently paralyzed. His legs have recovered since but his arms and hands still have limited mobility. The doctors have ordered a second MRI and there's a possibility that he needs to have another surgery. We originally would have waited about 3 weeks to be cleared to start the cancer treatments to hopefully slow the spread or even shrink the tumors but now that may be pushed back again. We don’t know what the future holds — whether we have months or years — but we are holding onto hope and taking things one day at a time.

What started out being a busy year of positive changes, from getting married after 7 years of dating to purchasing our first house together that we were remodeling in hopes to be our forever home together, all changed instantly.

What originated as a headache and stomach pain for Marcus got worse until we ended up at the Augusta ER two weekends ago. Marcus was severely anemic and admitted to the Augusta Health Hospital for several days. What started out as possibly an ulcer, then Celiac’s disease, after a CT scan and biopsy, we were then hit with the unexpected diagnosis: Marcus has early onset stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer in particular has a poor prognosis and limited treatment options, especially in later stages. His anemia and internal bleeding are still not under control, and he has had several blood transfusions. He is being treated at both Augusta Health and UVA, both of whom have been phenomenal. He starts his aggressive chemotherapy treatment next week at AH. UVA is working on getting Marcus into clinical trials for the newest drug treatment options. We may be required to travel for clinical trials.","$21,646","10K","August 29th, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/_qxYkCcMX_ZahHeokPGIHxSxJms=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94081369_1756394296185519_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-marcus-fight-against-pancreatic-cancer?qid=b5d2cb43372b8b4444deada8f1584348","Eyewear, Glasses, Vision Care, Happiness, Smile, Summer, Ear, Interaction, Love, Jewellery"

"Love for Leah's Cancer Journey","About a month ago, some of us received some of the most hardest news we've ever dealt with.
What started as a sore shoulder back in March, progressed to an ER trip that resulted in our dear Leah being diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer that has metastasized to her bones.
She is a mother to two beautiful children, Lacey Jane who is 4 and John Paul who is 2. She has a beautiful home in New Argyle that she has put so much labour and love into, and a career at the CRA.
And a week before her 35th birthday she was told this news that destabilized her life in so many ways.

Leah is not only very intelligent and kind to a fault, she steps into the role of mother, daughter, niece, granddaughter, friend and for some of us, a sister by heart, with such ease. She's shows up everyday, for everyone in her life in such a powerful way, so it's time for her people to show up for her.","$27,280","29K","July 24th, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/DTCEFSeiDWbMQS_Yr39cW2J9qTU=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93003857_1753389112283439_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/love-for-leahs-cancer-journey?qid=cbcc1d47db85d8a9e36132a812404107","Happiness, Formal wear, Flower, Event, Flower bouquet, Smile, Temple, Ceremony, Dress, Flower Arranging"

Edith is one of our line cooks and she has been diagnosed with breast cancer. She has begun her chemo treatments, and as can be expected, is struggling through the process. And like everyone else, the bills don't stop coming just because you can't work.
As a former cancer patient myself, I know how stressful these times are. Every little bit counts. My place of work took care of me when I had to go through this and I believe it is my duty to make sure I take care of Edith the same way I felt I was taken care of by my employer.

Chris is our eldest son. He went to the ER last week for what he *thought* was a bleeding ulcer. After many tests, it turns out it was cancer -- GIST (Gatro-Intestinal Stomal Tumor). So the docs gave him multiple transfusions to stabilize him before doing surgery on Saturday. Now, after losing most of his stomach and parts of his lung, liver, and bladder along with the tumor, he's on the mend. He was allowed some ice chips today (Monday) and was sooo relieved. The docs say he has to stay in the hospital several more days before he can go home, and he'll be away from work several weeks. This assumes all goes well.

We're asking folks to help him with his medical bills. Any amount will help. Family are pitching in, but we appreciate any assistance folks can give.

From Titans Mom Trisha,
""On May 30th Titan's Father and I took him to the ER due to finding a lump inside his cheek. While we were there they told us that it was most likely a clogged salivary duct and to massage the area and apply warm compresses. They did recommend a ultrasound of the area. That appt was scheduled for June 19th. The appointment was scheduled at a location that claimed to not see pediatric patients, so we had waited all that time for no reason. I immediately made him a appointment at his pediatric Dr to see if they had suggestions. Right after that appointment he was sent to the hospital for bloodwork and scheduled for an appointment at SCENT. Once at SCENT they referred him to have a CT Scan, which was done on July 21st. After the followup appointment he was referred to a Pediatric ENT in Charleston, SC on Sept 11th. When we arrived in Charleston we were pretty much clueless of what was going on. After examination of him they seemed very concerned and told us after the appointment that we would be hearing from them very soon. Not even a hour into our drive home the pediatric ENT called us. Titan was admitted into the hospital for a 4 day stay where he was monitored and had an MRI and biopsy done on the tumor to see if it was cancerous. He was discharged and we were told to wait on results. Results slowly started to come in and the doctors have a pretty good idea on the type of cancer it is (Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma) and had us come back to Charleston on Sept 23rd where we went over options. As of right now our plan is to start with surgery first to remove the tumor, then possibly radiation/Chemo. Titan must have some dental work done to prepare for the this. We will be headed back to Charleston on Monday Sept 29th to start this process.""","$5,512","7K","6 d ago","https://images.gofundme.com/wdciFi6sVuImRCEVDS_dXL1EXtY=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/95025449_1758841042458437_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-titans-fight-against-cancer?qid=cbcc1d47db85d8a9e36132a812404107","Health Care, Medical, Hospital, Medical equipment, Room, Patient, Health Professional, Clinic, Medical procedure, Hospital bed"

"support for my cancer treatment and recovery","Hello, friends and family. I'm writing today with some difficult news. This past Wednesday I was diagnosed with Squamous Cell Carcinoma. I woke up earlier this month with a sore throat. After about a week my sore throat was still there and started to fill a small lump on the left side of my neck. I went to the dr and was told it was probably a viral infection, as people around the area had been complaining of a sore throat. I took medicine for a week, and nothing changed, I was then treated for a bacterial infection for another 5 days and with still no change after that, my dr became ""very concerned"" I was then sent to an ENT(Ear, Nose, and Throat Specialist) He did some tests and took some pictures of my throat and saw some white patches on my tonsils. He scrapped some tissue off my tonsils and sent away for testing. I went and got a CT scan and after a week I went back to the dr and was told there was cancer cells on my tonsils, on some lymph nodes in my neck and part of my tongue. This news has been incredibly challenging for our family. We will stay strong through this, and I intend on showing this terrible disease that it messed with the wrong dude! I am asking for any and all prayers to help me through this hopefully not to long of a journey. There is also a financial burden that comes along with cancer treatments. This is part on the reason i started this page, for prayers and to help with expenses that my health insurance will not cover completely. I have another CT scan on Oct 2 which the first one i did was not covered completely by my insurance and this will also require money out of pocket. All medications will not be covered, and I am going to miss a significant amount of work while doing my treatments and also having surgery at some point. I also have another appt on Thursday in Atlanta as one dr thinks i need radiation every day for 6 weeks with added chemo and then surgery, while this dr on Thursday may want to do surgery first then chemo and radiation. It sure has been a hard last month to say the least. It certainly makes you think when you go to bed fine one day and a month later you are about to begin a fight for your life. Any donation, no matter the size will make a huge difference and also allow me to focus on my health and recovery as quickly as possible.

Gavriella has begun a grueling treatment plan that includes radiation 5 days a week at Pediatric Oncology Treatment Center which is roughly two hours one way.
While our medical insurance covers a portion of her treatment, the cost are still overwhelming. This fundraiser aims to help our family with uncovered medical expenses associated with her treatment.","$7,321","9K","September 23rd, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/hYb3jmyuZ4rpSZ0YwZ_vUXKbnJU=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94916409_1758643373144757_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-our-sweet-gavriella-fight-cancer?qid=30d8d5b8082dc040ec3979a1d57b8bac","Eyebrow, Lips, Forehead, Skin, Hairstyle, Jaw, Beauty, Black hair, Facial expression, Eyelash"
"Brynn’s Cancer Journey","Our sweet Brynn has been diagnosed with kidney cancer.

For those who don’t know her, Brynn is a bright, beautiful 8-year-old who just began 3rd grade. She adores her family and friends, shares an inseparable bond with her mom, Kristy, and has her dad, Zach, completely wrapped around her finger. Her brothers, Brandt and Brady, have always been her biggest protectors and cheerleaders. Beyond that, Brynn shines as a talented dancer at Just Dance, a fierce competitor on the softball field, and a baller on the basketball court.

What began as a normal weekend quickly turned into every parent’s nightmare. On Sunday, September 7th, Brynn was rushed by ambulance to Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital in Grand Rapids after doctors discovered a concerningly enlarged kidney. Further testing revealed a large cancerous mass that had overtaken most of her right kidney. By Wednesday, surgeons had to remove the kidney along with the tumor—larger than a softball.","$20,826","22K","September 21st, 2025","https://images.gofundme.com/ksbAnuQ05n0qVFvuFJVIjVVMiAc=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94871915_1758504107622632_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/brynns-cancer-journey?qid=78ccdfdafec166d0f8a67066d2e9e600","Hair, Smile, Happiness, Skin, Beauty, Mouth, Eye, Facial expression, Tooth, Pink"
"My Cancer Journey Continues","My Cancer Journey: Standing Strong in Faith
In 2023, I was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. I immediately began chemotherapy and radiation, and after six intense weeks, I was blessed to hear the words “in remission.” It felt like a miracle.
But in 2024, my world shifted again. The cancer returned—this time as stage 4. I began immunotherapy right away, and for a while, things were stable. With your generous support through my first GoFundMe, I was able to start a holistic regimen alongside my treatment. I ordered high-quality supplements and natural remedies, and for several months, the cancer didn’t grow or spread. That gave me hope.
Recently, however, I received more difficult news. The immunotherapy is no longer working, and we’ve had to stop it. I’ve now started a new round of chemotherapy with different drugs. It’s a tough road, but I’m standing strong in Faith and doing everything I can to stay positive.","$630","1.5K","5 d ago","https://images.gofundme.com/ZKSdR92speuLsrgWRuBbVqMXLFw=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/95045431_1758985732316637_r.png","https://www.gofundme.com/f/qr6gtq-my-cancer-journey-continues?qid=a57ed1c51057f1e7bd6c977de73fde26","Sky, Cloud, Blue, Cumulus, Meteorological phenomenon, Dusk, Afterglow, Sunrise, Sunlight, Sunset"

On his birthday in January 2021, our dad received the devastating news that he had cancer. Despite the diagnosis, he has spent the last four years living life to the fullest—crabbing on the bay, tending his garden (and sharing fresh produce with friends and family), artifact hunting, and creating unique works of art. Many of you may have even seen or bid on one of his hand-crafted railroad spike oyster knives, which he has generously donated to charities over the years.

Unfortunately, his cancer advanced, requiring an esophageal stent and additional rounds of chemotherapy. Even through treatments, he stayed active and hopeful. But in recent weeks, a sudden complication changed everything: he underwent emergency spinal surgery at Thomas Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia.

"Archer's Big Chop for Children with Cancer","Hi everyone,
My name is Archer and I’m 10 years old. I've spent a lot of my life with long hair. It's taken a long time to grow, and it's become a part of my identity. But I've been thinking a lot about children who don’t have a choice about losing their hair, especially because of cancer.

That’s why I've decided to shave my head for The Little Princess Trust. This charity does incredible work by providing free, real-hair wigs to children and young people. I know that donating my hair means it can be used to make a wig for someone who really needs it. It’s a way for me to give a piece of myself to help another person feel more confident and like themselves again.

I'm also hoping to raise money to help The Little Princess Trust continue their amazing work. Every donation helps them make more wigs and fund research to find new ways to fight childhood cancer.
