Please consider donating any amount you can to help the GCFA with our rising animal census and building costs for our recent A/C failures.
Our current census: 72 ferrets. We've had 2 A/C failures and need to raise money to permanently resolve our HVAC problem. On top of that, we've had to take multiple surrenders to the vet and the ER. It's been a busy month for the GCFA and we need some help from our Chicagoland community.

Help for Balkanabat Dog Haven,"My name is Dmitry, I live in Balkanabat, Turkmenistan. I am writing to you on behalf of a small group of people who care deeply about the fate of stray dogs in our country.
Recently, my dog-friend Govnaryk was almost killed during a cruel capture operation. In Turkmenistan, there are no official animal shelters or humane catching services. Stray dogs are often poisoned or killed publicly.
Right now, in Balkanabat, a small group of people try run a private shelter that survives only on the support of kind people. They care for about 50 dogs on a small plot of land without water supply or gas. Water is delivered by trucks, food is cooked on open fire, and medical help is almost unavailable – the nearest proper vet clinic is in Ashgabat (over 400 km away).

Support Daniel's Eagle Scout Project for the Animal Shelter,"Hi, my name is Daniel Watrous. I am a Life Scout with BSA Troop 321, and I'm working on my Eagle Scout Project. For my project, I chose to build a Catio for the Lynn Haven Animal Shelter. The Catio will be a small, enclosed play structure built into the current cat room of the Shelter.

The Lynn Haven Animal Shelter is near and dear to my heart because my family volunteers there every week. We walk dogs, clean up messes, and pet and socialize the cats. It makes my heart happy to know I'm helping care for someone's future pet.

Currently, there is no safe space for the cats to roam freely at the shelter, so the majority of their time is spent in their kennels. While the kennels are an adequate and safe space for the cats, it affords little room for them to exercise, play and interact with each other. My hope is that the Catio will be a fun and safe space for them to stretch their legs and play.",1500.0,1500.0,531.0,https://images.gofundme.com/H-EKZ8nalH3eeYBBBKIg45Oewg0=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/79614853_1713555461929226_r.jpeg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-daniels-eagle-scout-project-for-the-animal-shelter?qid=54a80c3c35ee527d2dd231684a3b567b,"Facial expression, Smile, Scout, Carnivores, Felidae, Felinae, Happiness, Boy Scouts of America, Whiskers, Cat",1

Anyway, I’ve got two incredible reasons to push through which is for an Animal shelter and a Dementia Organisation in South Africa.

Support Logan Johnson's Eagle Scout Project,"Hello, my name is Logan Johnson. I’m a seventeen-year-old senior from Bartlett, TN, and a member of Boy Scout Troop 261 from Bartlett Woods Church of Christ. I'm currently raising money for my Eagle project. The goal of my project is to replace the very old, broken-down birdhouses at the Bartlett Animal Shelter to give the purple martins in my community a place to live and thrive, keeping the sensitive species alive. Five 12-room houses will be built for the birds of the surrounding area. These houses will be located next to the animal shelter, featuring 15-foot telescopic poles, allowing for an easy clean and checkup on all the wildlife.

Each house and pole combination is approximately $300. Additional expenses include concrete and squirrel guards for each house. If there is any money left over, we may be able to add a bat house to one of the poles.

Support Jules' Recovery: Urgent Vet Care Needed,"If you've ever met my Jules, she already loves you. We got her as an 8-week-old puppy to help Carter adjust to his big brother moving out. Well, 10 years later, she has been the best friend anyone could ask for. But now, instead of her helping us through everything, she needs some help. I hate asking anyone for help, but I've exhausted my savings and I don't know what else to do. Jules started getting sick about a week ago and has gone downhill really fast. After lots of X-rays and blood tests, she has been diagnosed with pancreatitis. The vet says she needs to be hospitalized with IV fluids to even stand a chance. This will get pretty expensive and I just don't have it. I can't even afford to put her to sleep if I need to. After everything she's done for me when I needed her, I have to at least try. She deserves it. She still has a lot of years left and a ton of love left to give. Anything over what is needed for vet bills will be donated to a local animal shelter.

Lawyer fees to fight Memphis Animal Shelter,John Ryan has stood up to help us fight against Memphis Animal Shelter. Mr. Ryan Is donating his time because he too is a very passionate animal lover adopting several of his own babies. All donations collected will be going towards court and filing fees for the lawsuit against MAS. Back in June I started out as a foster for several ppp with Memphis Animal Shelter it did not take long to realize something was not right. One of my fosters came with a signed spay certificate that was not spayed come to find out my foster was not the only unaltered dog coming out of that shelter with signed certs. Since then there have been dogs coming out pregnant and almost immediately going into labor going by intake dates these dogs conceived while in the shelter. Where are these funds going the medication going if they are documenting surgeries or treatment yet not actually performing them? We have critical dogs not getting urgent pleas and waiting out 3 day stay holds suffering some resulting in death because they did not get the emergency vet care they needed nor was some of the severe injuries even noted in the records. We have fraudulent documentation on records of pets that were no longer in the care of MAS at the time yet MAS still noted an assessment and medication given. As we know there is a huge over population problem in Memphis and this is due to the irresponsible pet owners MAS has their own agenda. They have resources they could use or implement to try to save some lives yet they choose to kill than make the effort. There is a bus that can help transport to other shelters that have reached out but they refuse to call back. In 2019 before Covid hit they had the non violent inmate program that helped with basic volunteer needs they claim they do not have enough volunteers but have yet to take measures to restart the program. This could help by lifting the Covid hours they still run causing it almost impossible for the working class to make it to the shelter before or after work. There used to be a program where the university vet schools would help with spay and neuters that was also shut down when Covid hit but the program was never restarted again. Adoption events are far and few the vetting of Fosters and Adopters is bare minimum with an unbelievable return rate changing those dogs status to owner surrenders most do not get another plea and euthanized immediately. The tax payers pay for cameras inside the facility that are never on and have not been for sometime. They do not utilize music which would help keep the dogs calm but instead they choose to throw around FAS like candy at a Christmas Parade. There is an urgent plea daily causing it almost impossible to save the dogs we could if given more time. This is just a few of the things and it is more than enough but there is a process we have to take to make sure MAS is rid of the trash and held accountable for their actions! Animal Shelters are supposed to be there to help the animals but MAS just dispose of them like they are garbage. We need your help we are going to keep killing ourselves and so many more babies will die. Stand with us and fight! Enough is Enough!!

Help Jewel Beat Cancer!,"One of my long time “extra moms”, mentors, all of the above, has reached out about her baby girl, Jewel.

They adopted Jewel from Saint Francis Animal Shelter in South Carolina after losing one of their other rescues, Sadie.

Poor Jewel went into the vet thinking she had an infection with a bug bite, leaving with a much more devastating diagnosis. They believe she has a high chance of beating the cancer with five treatments, going every few weeks. These treatments are going to cost around $1300 each. They have done extensive research with multiple vets on the best treatment for her and this is it.

Sheridan Road Fire Pet Rehab Fund,"When a fire broke out in an apartment in the 600 block of Sheridan Road, the Evanston Fire Department was able to resuscitate the resident animals by administering oxygen on the scene.  Their quick action saved their lives, but it was obvious they still needed professional emergency medical care. Volunteers from the Evanston Animal Shelter and Dr. Gail Henry from Evanston Animal Hospital, who were onsite, rushed them to Blue Pearl, an emergency pet hospital, where they spent the night receiving supportive care. As you can imagine, the cost of emergency care is not cheap and the owner is struggling just to find a new place to live with her beloved pets in the aftermath of the fire. The cover photo (credit: Evanston Fire Department) is little Tinkerbell just minutes after being pulled from her smoke filled home. Two dogs, Tinkerbell and Opie have been taken into the Evanston Animal Shelter's custodial program. The shelter will cover the cost of their emergency treatment and any ongoing treatment they might require as they recover. The shelter will also care for Tinkerbell and Opie at no cost to the owner until she gets back on her feet. The expense of their emergency care has already put a strain on the shelter's budget. We are hoping the community will help us with these substantial costs.  We appreciate anything you can give.

Save Rosie: Urgent Medical Help Needed,"Our four month old kitten Rosie has FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis). We adopted her at the end of June from our local animal shelter where she was in rough shape when they first rescued her. We were so excited to give this sweet girl a home as my mother was looking for a therapy cat of her own. A week ago Rosie started having accidents outside of the litter box and that indicated a possible bigger problem, then her abdomen became distended and we knew that she needed to be seen. Rosie’s vet visit has racked up a bill that is already a financial hardship and with the treatment she needs at the animal hospital it is going to increase significantly. The initial vet visit ended with the understanding that without this treatment from the animal hospital Rosie does not have much time. Any and all donations are so incredibly appreciated and will be used to pay for her medical bills.",175.0,900.0,31.0,https://images.gofundme.com/gL0cMc_JTXSCa4pBrXGTMYcGwLA=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94200063_1756740008891497_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/as8bvw-save-rosie-urgent-medical-help-needed?qid=db1df4815572813bdc727e97ce0d912e,"Cat, Felidae, Carnivores, Felinae, Whiskers, Fur, Pet Supply, Snout, Cat Supply, Domestic short-haired cat",0
Emily and Her Young Son Need Urgent Support,"This is Emily and her young son.

Emily is a devoted single mother who has always worked hard to provide for her family. But for the first time in her life, she is facing an impossible situation. After 8 months of tirelessly searching for work with countless applications, interviews, and no offers. She has exhausted every resource. Her unemployment benefits ended 3 months ago, and despite trying other avenues to earn income, nothing has been enough to keep up with their living expenses.

Today, Emily is 3 months behind on rent, with utilities, phone service, and other bills piling up.

Save Periwinkle: Urgent Medical Help Needed,"Hello friends and family!! Thank you for your generosity. Here's what's happened: Periwinkle is my indoor only, tuxedo cat around 2 and half years old. I love her dearly. I adopted her from the Oakland Animal Shelter. This past weekend she has been very lethargic, and had a low appetite. On 8/11/2025 Periwinkle had no interest in eating at all, so I took her into the OakVet Animal Specialty Hospital as an emergency, and additionally set up an appointment at the soonest available time with Periwinkle's regular doctor at The Cheshire Cat Clinic. The initial check up showed she had a 103.8 high fever, was dehydrated, loss of fat and muscle, and was breathing hard and fast. The visiting Vet (DVM) suggested a General blood test, Chest x-ray, and Ultrasound of abdomen cavity. The blood test revealed a high white blood cell count indicative of infection and the x-ray revealed both of Periwinkle's lungs seemed to be consolidated. The DVM attempted to collect and sample any fluid outside of the lung but was not able to collect any fluid, because very little fluid was present at the time, leading for the DVM to believe Periwinkle was suffering from pneumonia. I was allowed to take Periwinkle home with instructions to administer antibiotics and monitor for signs of improvement (normal breathing rate). Periwinkle was still not interested in eating and very resistant to any syringe feeding. With much effort I was able to syringe her some meat flavored baby food and syringe the antibiotics, though this was very difficult. At home, Periwinkle was very clearly breathing hard, and struggling to be comfortable, though her breathing rate stayed the same and she was mobile and still very spunky. On 08/12/2025, at midnight I decided bring Periwinkle back into the OakVet Hospital to be hospitalized.",668.0,4500.0,51.0,https://images.gofundme.com/p-aFfvycYThgTaPY9j2FVnJukiY=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93602035_1755054360587561_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-periwinkle-urgent-medical-help-needed?qid=44fddf1546ad54ab55343e8b2894382c,"Cat, Felidae, Felinae, Carnivores, Whiskers, Snout, Pet Supply, Fur, Domestic short-haired cat, Mesh",0

Running for Ruger: Donate to Help Pets in Need,"Running for Ruger.

My name is Kristin Degnan and I’m running my first marathon in honor of my soul dog, Ruger, who crossed the rainbow bridge July 3, 2025. Ruger was an Australian Shepherd. I got him when I was 21 and we literally grew up together. He was, by far, the best dog I could have asked for. Ruger was smart, gentle, funny, loyal, patient, and sweet. He was my shadow, my best friend, and my adventure buddy for 11.5 wonderful years.

Ruger collapsed after a play session on July 1, 2025 and I rushed him to an emergency vet in Lynchburg, VA where they quickly pinpointed the issue. He had a significant amount of fluid around his heart that was preventing his heart from expanding normally. We went straight to Virginia Tech for an emergency cardiology consult. There, a dedicated team diagnosed the cause as a large mass on his right atrium, which was identified as angiosarcoma. In a matter of hours I went from living with my happy and healthy senior dog (who had just had recent blood work done and passed with flying colors), to my best friend having only days or weeks left to live as his body fought against this aggressive cancer. I chose to have the cardiology team remove the fluid from around his heart to make sure he was comfortable, so I could have a little bit of time to take him home, spoil him, and say goodbye to my best friend. He peacefully crossed the rainbow bridge 2 days later and I am now preparing to run the VA Beach Shamrock marathon in March of 2026 to honor Ruger and all the miles we walked/ran/traveled together.",2043.0,10500.0,70.0,https://images.gofundme.com/emGQweqUsuEmQVF720jkQUb9-10=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93007759_1753368208436471_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/running-for-ruger-donate-to-help-pets-in-need?qid=44fddf1546ad54ab55343e8b2894382c,"Dog, Carnivores, Snout, Herding dog, Fur, Canidae, Working animal, Border Collie, Australian Collie, Australian Shepherd",1

Fayetteville Animal Shelter Fund,"For animals like Bunny, the tailess Siamese suffering from a genetic disorder that left her shaking with palsy, Patience, the older Border Collie admitted weighing only 12 pounds, Skippy, the cat found hanging by a hind leg from a fence, and Sadie, the very pregnant Jack Russell mix, the Humane Society of Lincoln County (HSLC) Animal Shelter is a haven; a safe place to recuperate attended by compassionate caretakers.
The HSLC operates the only Animal Shelter in a county of 35,000 people. It admits over 1,200 cats and dogs on a yearly average and manages to find new homes for over 90% of them. A limited admission shelter, the HSLC could admit many more but instead adheres to a strict policy of not euthanizing any healthy adoptable dog or cat for lack of space.
Rather than trying to save every stray or abandoned animal in Lincoln County, the HSLC puts all its efforts into maintaining and improving the health and well being of those it does admit. Being limited admission, the Animal Care Attendants (ACA) have time to get to know each cat and dog, whether it’s shy and needs socialization, boisterous and needs training, underweight and needs a special diet, pregnant and needs a quiet space to have its young, or ailing and needs medical attention.
Animals may stay longer, on average 23 days, but that time improves their chances for adoption since the ACAs have time to groom them, work and play with them, and get them as healthy as possible so they will look, feel, and behave at their best to attract new owners.
All this attention costs money. For the HSLC, a non-profit 501 C 3 corporation, that means constantly hosting fund raisers, six or seven a year. The local city and county governments pay less than 1/3 of the HSLC annual budget; the rest must come from adoption fees and fundraisers. Adoption fees are ridiculously low and don’t begin to cover shots and other treatments each animal receives, pay salaries, buy food, kitty litter, disinfectants, and etc. Local fundraisers don’t bring in nearly enough revenue to pay the bills.
The HSLC is desperate to raise money for operating expenses. Without an influx of significant revenue, the HSLC may be forced to reduce the number of animals the Shelter can admit. That would be tragic for the unwanted and abandoned cats and dogs in Lincoln County. There is no other place for them to go.

Our small, vibrant community has been hit by hardship after hardship for the last several years and unfortunately many have been left without the means to properly care for themselves or for their animals.

Help Egyptian cats Hero and Monkey get back on their paws!,"My name is Aida and I am reaching out to you to help two Egyptian cats that I rescued from the streets of Zamalek (Cairo). In late July, I saw these two cats, Hero and Monkey, that needed urgent help. As a cat lover, I could not look away so I decided to help them and took them to the vet for treatment, which I have been paying with pocket money.

I would be enormously grateful if any animal lovers out there can financially support their treatment while I search for a loving foster/adoption home for them!

Hero
Hero, which deserves no other name, had been surviving with a hanging broken paw since at least back in February this year, drawing people’s attention on Facebook.

Help Ginger Fight FIP,"Our cats Ginger (orange cat) and Mimi (gray cat) were born from the same litter and threatened to be sent to an animal shelter due to a housing situation. We took them both in as an attempt to give them a great life. These cats have grown together for every second of their lives and are now inseparable brothers.

Recently, Ginger was having weird behavior and intense breathing cycles, so we decided to take him to the emergency vet to figure out what was wrong with him. After paying $1,200 out of pocket and waiting 4 hours, we received the news that he was diagnosed with Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP). Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a serious illness in cats caused by a mutated form of a common virus called the feline coronavirus (FCoV). Many cats carry the regular feline coronavirus and don't get sick, but for a select few, like Ginger, it mutates inside the body and turns into the dangerous form that causes FIP. Ginger has ""Dry"" FIP, which causes inflammation in organs like the eyes, brain, or kidneys, leading to symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or neurological signs.",648.0,2000.0,12.0,https://images.gofundme.com/2AJ60Z5w48SKxoBoXwsOAsEDhOE=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94833723_1758390866816795_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/t4ncgs-help-ginger-fight-fip?qid=44fddf1546ad54ab55343e8b2894382c,"Cat, Felidae, Vertebrate, Felinae, Carnivores, Fur, Snout, Terrestrial animal, Whiskers, Tail",0
We're Opening an Animal Shelter!,"We’re opening an animal shelter! We are Danielle Dyer and Emera Thornton of Bark’s Play and Stay in Grand Junction, Colorado. We have almost 20 years combined experience working with dogs, and have seen a growing need in the valley for more resources to combat the vast number of abandoned, homeless, or relinquished animals. Since opening in 2014, Bark’s itself has fostered and rehomed several dogs to their forever homes, but we want to do more! We NEED to do more. We have enrolled in a workshop taught by the amazing Best Friends Animal Society specifically for starting and running an animal shelter. Best Friends is one of the most successful non-profit animal welfare organizations in America and has been helping to rescue animals and educate communities nationwide since 1968. They are an incredible resource, and we are so fortunate to have the privilege of their guidance and knowledge as we start down this new path. And knowing that the money we pay to attend this workshop goes to such a great cause makes us even more happy!

Until about a year ago, any financial needs that arose for our foster dogs were paid for out of pocket. However, our number of dogs waiting for forever homes continued to grow, and in summer of 2017 we began fundraising to start a bona fide shelter. While we have raised a considerable amount of money, we would prefer that money go directly to the animals, so we are here to ask for assistance in funding for the workshop itself. The cost breakdown is below, and any money raised above our needs will be donated directly back to our shelter and our 6 current foster dogs who are waiting for new homes. We know that our knowledge and experience in running a thriving animal care business, when paired with what Best Friends will teach us about non-profit status and shelter specifics, we will have a truly solid foundation moving forward. We are so excited to give back to our community and our furry friends. Thank you so much for helping us to Save Them All!

Donate to ARK: Shelter and Care for Kefalonia's Pets,"Hi, I’m Alex Markantonatos Davis from Portland, Oregon.

I traveled to Kefalonia, Greece in June of 2025. Kefalonia is the largest Ionian Island. The village of Dorizata is where my dad is from. I was there for 6 weeks.
Time was spent with family and friends and the many feral cats we encountered. I wanted to volunteer at an animal shelter, so I looked it up and volunteered at the ARK, Animal Rescue Kefalonia. It is located in Argostoli about 10-15 minutes from Dorizata.

Since I was there last, laws have changed. Abuse and neglect are not tolerated, and there are consequences. Spaying and neutering are very well needed. The ARK is where stray animals are taken and given the chance to live a safer life until a forever home comes along. I love how this community comes together; some locals bring food for both the volunteers and animals but help is always needed financially and physically.

As a low kill, humane shelter, they are not allowed to euthanize animals just to keep the numbers manageable, as per state laws. However, the commissioners are demanding just that. We need a solution to keep the shelter up and running while this debacle is worked out among all parties. We need YOU to step up, if you can possible do so, with a contribution, no matter how small, to keep the doors open and the animals cared for. Monthly contributions would be best!

Help Gordo get the care he deserves,"Our sweet little Gordo isn’t just a dog—he’s family. He’s kind, playful, and has brought so much joy, comfort, and laughter into our lives. Through tough times, he has been our source of emotional support and happiness, always reminding us what unconditional love truly means.
Recently, Gordo’s health has taken a difficult turn. He’s been seen by an eye specialist in Riverview, and now he needs to undergo an MRI in PEI as well as cancer screening in Dieppe. These tests are crucial to finding out what’s wrong and giving him the best chance at recovery.
We do have pet insurance, but unfortunately it doesn’t come close to covering all of these costs. As loving dog parents, we want to do everything possible for him, but the medical expenses are overwhelming.
That’s why we’re reaching out to our community, to all the fellow animal lovers out there who understand just how much our pets mean to us.

Save Macy's Life: Urgent Heart Surgery Needed,"I am raising funds to save my shelter dog, Macy's life. I adopted Macy on June 17, 2025 from the Tehama County Animal Shelter. She had kennel cough twice when she was in the shelter. She also had giardia. The cardiologist says she needs a heart surgery that costs $10,000. She was born with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Insurance will not cover the cost because she was born with the condition. Her life expectancy is approximately one year if she doesn't receive the surgery. Since she is already 7 months old, she needs the surgery soon. if the surgery is successful, she will have a nearly normal life expectancy.
Despite her health issues, Macy has a ton of energy. She had chewed many items in the house, and she runs her zoomies everyday. Hopefully we get the surgery done before any heart damage occurs.
Macy is the perfect addition to our family, my other dog, Abby is so happy to have Macy. We love Macy, and the thought of losing her is unbearable.

I also noticed that the donation box is an old animal shelter that is not enclosed. It has paint coming off it due to past weather, which needs to be addressed to save and keep donations.

My project is to create 4 cat shelters and a donation box for the Animal Shelter. These cat houses would be used to create homes for the feral cats found in Newtown. Once a feral cat is caught, it is brought to the animal shelter. They are kept outside in an open-air shelter and need insulated houses to keep them warm in the winter months.

Support Buster's Recovery Journey,"on a saturday night my boyfriend and i were on our way to dave n busters down on columbus blvd. on the way down there was a lady stopped on the side of the road with a full grown pit jumping up on her car. we pull over to help. we notice a puppy on the side in a target bag. i instantly ran over to see if i was seeing things or not. the second he climbed on to my lap i knew i could not let go. i did not want to separate them, so i called everyone i knew to keep both dogs until i could figure out what to do. we couldn’t bring the big one back because we didn’t know how he was with other big dogs. (patrick already has dog and we didn’t want to up his dog or the other dog in danger.) so we brought him to the ACCT Philly. If it was someone’s pets they would be safe there. as we pulled up i could not let the puppy go to shelter. he was skin and bones and i could not let him grow up in a shelter. he was very clearly dumped there and I wasn’t letting the cruel world take his chances on him. we brought him home and gave him the world . there was very clearly something wrong with him i tried to get him a vet appointment but there was a misunderstanding. patrick was 3 minutes late and they would not see the puppy. i called and got him into one near my work for this saturday. i got home on Thursday and buster was not doing okay. we wasn’t eating, drinking, standing up. we rushed him to the a mount laurel animal hospital. where they instantly took him back and took care of him. within an hour they called us back to a room and the dr. told us our buster boy would need a blood transfusion as soon as possible. buster rbc count was 5 where normal dogs would be 30. this was clearly an emergency expense. if anyone can donate so this baby can live his wonderful life and come home and snuggle with mom and dad. if you can’t donate please share. i donate weekly to animal shelters all around and try to help where i can.

Running for Friends at West LA Animal Shelter,"A few years ago I did something crazy - I ran a half marathon… then I ran a couple more … then I ruptured my achilles…Once I started to walk again I thought, what if I trained for a marathon?

Here we are 15 weeks into training and I have 12 more weeks to go before the LA Marathon - March 17.

While exercise brings me a lot of joy and sanity, I’ve found volunteering at the West Valley Animal Shelter brings me even more. That’s why I’ve decided to raise money for West Valley Animal Shelter as I train for the LA Marathon. I pledge to match the donation for every dollar donated.

Help Friends of Madera Shelter replace our stolen van,"Hi, I'm Kirsten Parksion, and I'm reaching out to you to support the Friends of Madera Animal Shelter. We had one of our vans stolen. For our organization this is devastating. We work from mainly volunteers and limited donations. To replace this van it would take a large majority of our funds that currently go to in need animals. Without donations it is not possible for us to replace it at this time. We are in desperate need of donations to help reach our goal and replace our van. With new laws we are required to have air conditioned transport vehicle so to replace the van we need about 75000 for the van itself and the necessary upgrades to legally transport animals. We use these vans every day in our rescue organization for spay and neuter and transporting animals for adoptions. Any help you can provide is greatly appreciated and will go directly to replacing our van. This amazing organization is dedicated to educating our community and raising vital funds and providing transportaion to spay and neuter animals in Madera County, while also facilitating pet adoptions.

Lucedale Animal Shelter Fund,"We are Dixie Adoptables , a small non-profit animal shelter in Lucedale, MS. Through a lot of hard work, we were recently chosen by the city to take over operations of the city animal shelter.  We are raising money to do the work needed to get the shelter in shape for this change. 

We will be taking over operations of the shelter on October 1, 2016 and we have lots to do to get ready. The shelter is already full of animals who will need care during the transition, and we need to expand the capacity and get new equipment in place to provide the proper level of care now and well into the future. 

The funds donated will be used to make all of this happen by purchasing:

* Shelter supplies
* Exam tables
* Vet scale
* Stainless steel vet cages
* Storage cabinets
* New cat building
* Sanitary food storage
* Repainting and major repairs the facilities
* Refridgerator
* Washer & dryer
* Cat fencing
* Office furniture & supplies
* Security system (upgrade)
* Commercial cleaning equipment
* New steel doors
* Concrete repairs
* New kennel doors & door repairs
* Heating & cooling 
* Washing/bathing tub
* New gravel for exercise yards
* Covers/sun shades for exercise yards

This is something that we have been working towards for a long time and something that the city of Lucedale has needed even longer. With this opportunity, we will be able to help hundreds of animals every year that would otherwise starve or die of sickness and exposure. This means a great deal to us and to our community, and we hope it means a lot to you as well.  Please consider joining other animal lovers in George County and giving any amount that you can afford to help these pets. 

In the end, it is about saving animals in our community that have no other hope and giving them a new life. It always has been and always will be.

Donate To Raise Funds For Gabriella's Bone Tumour Surgery,"Hi, my name is Adam, and I am asking for your help to raise money for my partner, Gabriella's surgery to remove a meningioma and a bone tumour located on her left frontal lobe.

I met Gabriella around 8 years ago in Chiang Mai, Thailand. What started as a chance encounter on Christmas eve soon blossomed into a beautiful love story that we have been writing together ever since. Over the years we have shared so many magical experiences on our journey and have loved, laughed, cried and grown together, and adopted, raised and cared for 5 wonderful cats and dogs. We have also faced many challenges together.

Recently Gabriella has encountered a number of health problems, tumours found in multiple parts of her body, biopsies and the terror, stress and ongoing medical examinations which go with those situations.

This expense is huge and unexpected — and not in our budget.  We must therefore issue this emergency plea for help. We must replace these machines as soon as possible to meet the standard of care we deem necessary for a safe, healthful environment.

Help Save Clay County Animal Shelter,"In 2014, seeing a great need, Nancy Bailey spearheaded a campaign to establish a Animal Shelter in Clay County. She began by calling a great group of ladies who held the same passion for homeless animals that she did. They all agreed there was a huge need as well, so they began meeting on a regular basis to try to make this become a reality.

After a year of numerous meetings, brainstorming, fundraising,  etc., The Clay County Animal Shelter opened in September 2015. The need was so great that their facility was full when opened.

At first, it was very well received by the public and they had lots of volunteers, contributions and support from the community. They were able to stay afloat by donations, fundraisers and support from the cities and County.

Because they were leasing the building from a former Veterinarian,  they were hoping to do a rent to own, however that did not go as planned when the building exchanged hands.

After the new wore off, the Volunteers were scarce. These ladies worked very hard seven days a week and never received a penny for their contribution to society.

In March 2016, Nancy Bailey lost her battle against cancer. One of her dying wishes was that the Shelter remain open, however,  this is where the downward spiral for the facility began, as many obstacles were thrown in this path. The Shelter became the innocent victim in a political battle which kept them in court over funding for three years, which I won't even get into because it is ridiculous. But in the end,  the Shelter lost the fight.

With volunteers falling off, The county began letting a few inmates work at the Shelter, but this didn't last long before things went downhill and had to be stopped. One of the inmates who worked there went back after his release and although on the outside appeared to be a great worker, was robbing them blind. He even broke into some of the ladies homes as well. He remains in jail at this time.

At this time, the Shelter is struggling to stay open. Their donations, which is their sole income have dwindled to just a handful of long-time supporters. They received word that their rent will increase to $700 next month, not to mention, that the building they rent is for sale. There are also many much-needed repairs to the building as well. 

Our mission here is to raise enough money to buy this building for the Shelter, plus expense for these vital repairs. If the Shelter owns the building, they will not only be free of their biggest debt,  they will also be able to apply for grants that would keep them self-sufficient.

Over the past 6 years, The Shelter has helped save over 1600 animals and is much-needed in this county. They are a no-kill 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and have survived with the support of their community and they need our help now more than ever.

The cost of the building is $112,000 and the repairs will cost well over $25,000. Therefore, we are asking, or pleading for your support in ending this financial struggle this facility has been drowning in for years. If our goal is not met, we will make sure that whatever money is raised will go towards future rent, utilities,, and repairs of the building.

Help us fight back against OCAC and bring Grim home.,"Grim, our gentle giant, isn’t just a dog—he’s family. For the past nine months, since rescuing him from Devore Animal Shelter, he has filled our lives with love, loyalty, and joy. Now, his life is under threat once again. Orange County Animal Control (OCAC) has placed Grim in quarantine and is fighting to take his life away. After surviving a high-kill shelter, he was given a second chance—and now they want to end it.

IMMEDIATE NEED: Save Our Animal Shelter!,"Innocent Angels Sanctuary has been instrumental in helping homeless and abandoned dogs and cats get off the streets in Fresno and Madera counties for years. Many of the pets have been neglected, abused, injured, or have a disability or long-term illness. These pets were not turned away during their time of need. We purchased land and a home outside of Clovis to move our shelter to, but sadly learned that we were misinformed about the zoning of this new location and we are not permitted to have more than four dogs at the new site. We later learned that our current shelter location has the same issue. We are in desperate need of not only finding a new place to move our shelter pets to, but also to cover basic medical expenses and food costs for the animals. We lost so much of our funds in the purchasing and remodeling of the new location that we sadly had to turn around and sell again, this time at a loss of around $400,000. In addition, we had one of our precious litters of puppies come down with parvovirus. They were rushed to the emergency vet where they received the best of care, but tragically not all of them survived the ordeal and we are left with bills for their veterinary care totaling in the thousands. Any help that you would be able to spare for our cause would be greatly appreciated. We never turned our backs on these pets when they needed us the most, and now we are reaching out to you to not turn your backs on us. Please help us help the animals in our care.

Help Archer Get the Medical Care He Needs,"Hello All!

A little about our family…My name is Shelbi. My husband Phillip and our son Pj have a Belgian Malinois named Archer. We got Archer when we moved to Colorado 9 years ago and he was just 8 weeks old. My husband has been at Copper since 2016 and I have been working at the hospital since 2018. We are very outdoorsy people and we have been able to provide that type of lifestyle for Archer his whole life and even though he’s 9 anyone who has ever met him says he still acts like a puppy.

For the past month Archer has been very sick with lots of GI related issues. Since mid August we have spent $3k alone trying to find out what’s wrong with him. We had masses tested for cancer and bloodwork sent to Texas. He’s been on many different meds non stop since his symptoms started. We had an ultrasound done as well. We have tried every avenue to get him better but the next step is to get a liver biopsy. Our estimated cost for the tests before treatment is $4.2k-$4.5k.",1685.0,2400.0,8.0,https://images.gofundme.com/Uo-tzm_vaAYBHu-UO15LoXOaK_w=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94998889_1758768274909646_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-archer-get-the-medical-care-he-needs?qid=44fddf1546ad54ab55343e8b2894382c,"Dog, Carnivores, Snout, Terrestrial animal, Canidae, Yawn, Herding dog, Tongue, Working animal, Fur",1

If you visit the Puerto Vallarta area, the shelter always welcomes visitors, volunteers, and donations of pet supplies, food and funds.

Support Vinny's Fight for Health and a Home,"Help Vinny (formally known as Buddy at Dallas Animal Shelter) Get the Care He Deserves

Vinny’s story is one of love, loss, and resilience. He originally came from a loving home, but when his owner suffered a stroke and was hospitalized, Vinny and his two sisters ended up at the shelter. His sisters were adopted, but Vinny wasn’t as lucky. On top of losing his family, he was placed in a shelter that was experiencing a distemper outbreak — making his odds of staying healthy and finding a home even harder.

That’s when I stepped in to foster him, hoping to give him a better chance to fight off illness and eventually find the forever family he deserves. Sadly, things haven’t been going in our favor. Vinny is now battling distemper, which has reached his neurological system & is the biggest fight of his life yet.

Art Benfield Animal Shelter Gift,"My father, Arthur Benfield, was a man who believed that, ""One person can't change the world, but they can certainly change their little piece of it."" Because of that drive to help others, he spent his lifetime working to change the lives of many people and animals in Pueblo, CO.

On February 27, 2016, Arthur died suddenly from the H1N1 influenza virus and left behind not only a legacy of service but also some unfinished business: Two big projects at the SoCo Spay and Neuter Clinic in Pueblo Colorado (http://www.socospay.com/). We need your help to make one final change in Arthur's part of the world.

The first project my father was envisioning was a ""cat patio"" for the shelter's permanent cat residents. Currently these cats live in a basement with no real access to fresh air, sunlight, or moths to chase. Arthur wanted to create an access point from that basement room to a small fenced in ""cat patio"" on the small grassy area near the clinic's parking lot. The project will cost $10,000 for fencing, parking barriers, and basement access and the clinic is ready to build as soon as the money is raised.

. Arthur wanted to get fun and long lasting ""playground"" equipment for the dogs to enjoy outside and also wanted to provide benches for onlookers. My dad figured that even if someone can't manage, afford, or keep an animal of their own, they should still have a place to go see and play with them. A $5,000 dog playground would build seating for humans and interactives for dogs while also building friendships that last forever. Again, the clinic is ready and willing to create just such a space immediately if the funds can be raised. 

Arthur's legacy, first as a public school teacher for 30 years and then as a active community member who donated, organized, and worked on behalf of those less fortunate, lives on in the lives and thoughts of many people. However, the void that is created by his passing within the community can not be overstated. For his friends and family to know that his impact could become a permanent part of one of his favorite charities would be a tremendous final gift from Arthur to the world.

All funds raised will benefit the SoCo Spay and Neuter Clinic.. If, and when, we exceed the $15,000 goal the clinic will direct that money toward another program my dad championed: providing free vaccinations to the animals of veterans and/or homeless individuals.",6175.0,15000.0,3503.0,https://images.gofundme.com/i3TXyJsVvUWNr1fPkEYyZO6Sqts=/1200x900/https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9563235_1456779614.4303.jpg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/rerw97wc?qid=aba8518be6e50e5e90adc75a115b7193,"Cat, Eyewear, Glasses, Felidae, Skin, Vision Care, Felinae, Vertebrate, Facial hair, Carnivores",1
Blackstone Regional Animal Shelter new floors,"Do you like animals and want to help make sure shelter life is the best it can be?


Hello, my name is Noah and I am a boy scout of Troop 1 in Blackstone. For my eagle project, I am looking to refinish the floors in the Blackstone Regional Animal Shelter. This shelter may be small from the outside, but it actually services 5 different communities in the Blackstone Valley (Millville, Douglas, Mendon, Uxbridge, Blackstone)

Why I need your help. When I approached ACO Sullivan with my passions for animals and my impending eagle project, we went over the needs and wants of the Shelter and determined the biggest need to benefit the entire shelter.  With cement floors throughout the seven rooms which make up the Animal Shelter, the biggest obstacle is ensuring they are non-permeable. As you may or may not know, cement is porous and must be coated to protect from moisture and germs. With the current coating giving a short-term solution, my research has led me to find a specialized concrete coating which would be more suitable, last significantly longer, and hold up better to all cleaning solutions.

Since this is not a project I can accomplish on my own, I have reached out to and received quotes from several installation companies. These types of flooring materials are costly which is why I am requesting your help in raising the funds for this project.  Any additional funds collected beyond the project goal will be donated to the Blackstone Regional Animal Shelter.",1959.0,10000.0,1913.0,https://images.gofundme.com/vCTcKK8qhvKIF2GCZuEATGWiyj8=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49467936_1594164676202620_r.jpeg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/blackstone-regional-animal-shelter-new-floors?qid=24b7fcc1b75d583a5827127644c1df23,"Door, Siding, Yard, Paint",1

Help Save The Animals at the Bruno Project Shelter,"If you have been following my journey with Saint, you will know that at our lowest point when, Air Canada was refusing to let me take him on the flight, we were saved by the amazing people at The Bruno Project. Had it not been for them I truly don’t know how this story would have ended. They immediately stepped up and fostered Saint until I could organize things all the way over here in Canada. There were no guarantees on how this was going to go down, but they didn’t mind, they saw an animal in need and didn’t look any further.

The shelter is operated by SLAPS, The St Lucia Animal Protection Society, and its amazing organizers have committed themselves to helping stray dogs and cats in St Lucia and because of them many animals are now with their forever homes all around the world - but now they need OUR help.

The owners of the land on which Bruno Project is located have sold it, and now Bruno only has one month to relocate 80 dogs and cats. This organization steps up everyday to aid animals in need, they leave no one behind and are guardian angels as they pair them with new families ready to love them, they deserve the same help in return. Because of how they saved my little Sainty, I have started a go fund me to help them during this difficult time. Funds will go to helping relocate their organization under this insane time crunch and to help ensure all animals are cared for, and getting some flown out to their families. Some airlines have stopped flights in and out of St Lucia indefinitely and travel is at all time low, but that doesn’t put a pause on saving animals in need.

While I know it is a difficult time to for all of us financially, a little goes a long way and would mean the world to this organization and the animals it cares for.

My birthday is Feb 2nd and if you would have even bought me a drink or a card I encourage you to relocate to those funds to help out this amazing organization.

Help Lynne and Twinnion Overcome Financial Strain,"A Message from Lynne Miller Thompson

Many of you know my work, even if you don’t know me personally. Since 2015, I’ve been behind the camera and the keyboard for countless Rowan County Animal Shelter photos and videos—working to give the cats and kittens there a voice and a chance at life. Volunteering with the shelter and rescues has been one of the greatest joys of my life.

What most people don’t know is that I’ve also been quietly fighting serious health issues for years. In the past eight months, I’ve been hospitalized four different times, each for long stretches. Unfortunately, my health will only continue to decline. It has been exhausting and frightening, but what has made it even harder is the toll it’s taken on our family. My husband, Twinnion, has missed a great deal of work to care for me and take me to appointments. He’s used all of his vacation time, and now much of that time off is unpaid. Together, we’ve fallen behind on even the basics—our mortgage, utilities, insurance and affording the cataract surgery that I'm needing.",5282.0,2800.0,39.0,https://images.gofundme.com/QYAqFIb29N-7p-7FidRj7wI4M7A=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93966375_1756081799386925_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-lynne-and-twinnion-overcome-financial-strain?qid=a3d3014d3624c7c20bb3187cd0a7e5a2,"Eyewear, Facial expression, Tooth, Smile, Eyelash, Whiskers, Happiness, Selfie, Felidae, Fur",1
Support Enzo's Urgent Eye Surgery,"I rescued my Enzo from a local animal shelter in Tampa almost three years ago. He had been at the shelter for over a month and was already completely blind. He was found as a stray on the street, covered in fleas, and had no fur. Unfortunately, being held at a not-for-profit shelter, they weren’t able to do much or know much about the state of his sight. I knew adopting him would already be a big responsibility, especially since I was just starting college. But from the moment I saw him, I knew he was the one. He was a happy and overall very healthy pup. I did as much as I could to give him the best life possible while I was attending school.

Recently, I took him to his first veterinary eye specialist to make sure that his eyes were healthy, despite the blindness, and if there was anything I could be doing to enhance his health. Unfortunately, the vet informed me that he had a very severe case of glaucoma (which caused his eyes to become enlarged) and was dealing with chronic pain. The vets told me that he was likely born this way and there wasn’t much I could’ve done early on for him. They told me while there is medication for his condition, in his case, they would prove to be ineffective. The only option would be full removal of his eyes. I was so heartbroken when I heard the news and was devastated to hear he’s been suffering all this time. Luckily the surgery has a very fast recovery time and he will be back to normal within a month.",2880.0,2800.0,80.0,https://images.gofundme.com/zhYbCL306-5BQVMDAk76uWjFDsk=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/92697683_175253222447913_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-enzos-urgent-eye-surgery?qid=3e05da99384bba523046eac5ff850c53,"Dog, Vertebrate, Carnivores, Snout, Working animal, Canidae, Pet Supply",1

Save Faith - Pup Covered with Sores,"There is no holiday for rescue. This afternoon, RBARI received a desperate call from New Jersey Animal Control. A dog was found roaming the streets of Union City with painful pressure sores covering her body. She was emaciated and dehydrated with protruding nipples and in need of immediate medical care, so Animal Control brought her straight to RBARI. We set our eyes on this sweet girl and named her Faith because somehow, through the horrors she had lived, she had faith in us as humans and forgave.

Faith was rushed to Oradell Animal Hospital. Her wounds needed immediate attention, and she was severely dehydrated and emaciated. Faith’s tail never stops wagging; she never runs out of kisses. Faith was likely bred. She is young, but her nipples protrude like those of a mama that has been used and discarded. Faith’s tail is crooked and broken – the pressure sores on her backside are so painful that she can’t sit down comfortably. She literally has no comfortable position to lay, sit or stand because of the number and severity of sores many of them an inch deep – they cover her legs, joints, hind end, tail, and spine - but through the pain, her tail wags uncontrollably.
Faith’s front legs are deformed – bent in likely from backyard breeding in an effort to create a “pocket pit.” We can only guess that she spent this summer, and many months / years before it, laying on hot concrete with no relief creating the sores. Because of her emaciated state, she has virtually no padding to protect her. Upon entry to the emergency hospital, Faith went to the bathroom and her feces was full of crayons. It’s heartbreaking that she resorted to eating whatever she could find in her state of starvation. Faith had to be sedated to shave and clean her wounds – she was extremely cooperative, but the pain was too much, and no one wanted to see our sweet girl go through anything else. Faith’s initial medical care and hospitalization is estimated at $2,500, and she has a long road to recovery.
Who needs a holiday, when we have Faith? Her amazing loving spirit inspires us to continue to rescue because even when we at times feel disillusioned, these beautiful dogs maintains a steadfast Faith that people are good. We can’t let Faith down.",3125.0,3000.0,3314.0,https://images.gofundme.com/UCawf2E1CBt6TA88QKF5rKQvUsc=/1200x900/https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/14278439_1473118765.7629.jpg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/2neeqvg?qid=aba8518be6e50e5e90adc75a115b7193,"Dog, Carnivores, Snout, Pet Supply, Working animal, Canidae, Collar, Dog collar, Pit bull, American Pit Bull Terrier",1

Desperate Brazilian Animal Shelter,"Help me raise money for a shelter in my home town in Brazil (Veranopolis, RGS). They desperately need kennels built and a play yard so the dogs can be let off their chains. Currently dogs never get let off chains because there isn't anywhere to safely walk them, much less a play yard where volunteers and staff can interact with the dogs. Half the population of 200 dogs are chained to small housing year round. They need to build new kennels for the dogs on chains, a play yard for interaction and excersise, and a proper isolation area for sick dogs. The cost for the play yard is estimated at $6,000. The new kennels cost $37,000. The new isolation area is estimated at $26,000. They already have all the approval and plans drawn. Just need the funding. The shelter is managed by ONG Instinto Coruja, a non profit organization. The original shelter was built to house 120 dogs. There are currently over 200. The kennels that do exist house 2-3 dogs each. The rest are chained to a make shift dog house until they are adopted or potentially spend the rest of their lives in that condition. The small houses are not adequate protection from the elements. Volunteers knit and provide sweaters for the dogs during the very cold and rainy months. Please donate if you can. I will try and raise anything to help build at least the play yard so they find a little joy. Count your blessings America. Share some if you can.

Equador and Galapagos Islands Expedition,"Hi! In two years time with the help of Camps International, I, alongside a group of people from my school, am going to Ecuador for an expedition with impact.

These indiginous communities have often been forgotten by the government and I want to make a real difference to improve their lives for the long term. The projects we will undertake will be locally resourced and sustainable to minimise the environmental impact and to help the local economy.
In addition to this, we will travel to the Galapagos Islands to learn about the importance of conservation and how we can help maintain this ecologically important area.

Newberg Animal Shelter Make New Outside Structures,"Hi, my name is Taylie and I am fundraising for the Newberg Animal Shelter in Newberg, Oregon. I am a Girl Scout and for my gold award project I am building three new outside, semi-permanent, structures that will help to ensure the dogs stay cool in the summer while still getting outside time. Or out of the rain while still getting outside time! These structures will last many years and be much more sustainable than what the shelter currently uses to give the dogs shade.
This is an important issue for me because shelters all around the world have issues with funding.

Dog Beds for Lee County Animal Shelter,"***UPDATE Nov. 16, 2019*** Great news! We have ordered 48 Kuranda beds and they will be delivered to the Lee County Animal Shelter at the end of the week. Any additional funds that come in this week will be used to purchase blankets for the dogs. Now we need to coordinate volunteers to put them together. If we can get two dozen volunteers to meet out at the shelter on Saturday, November 23rd at 10 am , we can easily have them put together and installed by noon. Please email me if you can help! [email redacted]. Thank you!!

As winter is upon us, the dogs at Lee County Animal Shelter in Bishopville, SC are spending their nights in freezing temperatures in outdoor kennels. Making this situation worse, they are sleeping on the cold concrete. Last night the temperatures dipped into the teens. As you can imagine, this is really hard on a dog.

After speaking to Brandi Sowell at LCAS, she told me that the ideal dog beds for their shelter are Kuranda beds. Kuranda Dog Kennel Beds are perfect for shelters because they are indestructible, they get the dogs up off of the ground, and the fabric provides real orthopedic comfort for the dogs. I called Kuranda on Wednesday, Nov. 13, and learned that NoMA Bark Park's 501c3 non-profit status makes it feasible for us to order the beds for Lee County Animal Shelter at a steep non-profit discount. 

$4000 will cover the cost of 48 XL Kuranda Kennel Beds, plus the cost of shipping. Normally the cost for one of these beds is $114, we can get them for $70 if we place an order for more than 30 beds. 

Please consider helping this shelter. These beds are an excellent investment and will last them forever.  Our dollars together will go a lot farther than individual donations. 

The Lee County Animal Shelter has a webpage for donating Kuranda beds: but as you'll see, the price per bed is much higher than buying them in bulk. 

Let's help some pups ride out the harsh winter nights in just a bit more comfort than their current situation of sleeping on the cold concrete.

Your donation is a charitable donation. NoMA Bark Park is a 501c3. Absolutely every penny of this fundraiser will go to this project. We have no administrative costs or overhead.

Thank you!

EL Harris Emergency Animal Shelter,"My Dad, “Pops” Ernest Lee Harris Jr, died on January 5th, 2018, of sudden cardiac arrest   He was only  58    

We had all expected to watch him grow in a funny ornery ole man  

My mom and dad lived here, San Diego and later Oceanside,  for more than 30 years     They loved loved loved San Diego County     

About 3 years ago, they found their “home with a view” And moved to Valley Center,  

Pops had taken on the day to day routines and hard ass work - but quiet life of a country landowner.   










For his family and for all of those people he touched here in California and all of those characters that he met in his travels and for those of you who have asked how you can  help, this is that thing   


We set up this GoFundMe account -  for our Pops, for our mothers hope to make “Mr. Harris” proud    







   

We hope you’ll send this out to your connections, , to random kind people and all your friends and family  

We will keep checking back with al of you and by the end of this summer, want to have the supplies  and hire the  contractors    Our goal  to make this happen by Jan 5 , 2019

Emaciated Shih Tzu Tossed from Car,"A car slowed down and tossed out a tiny bundle of fur, then sped off without a look back.  It was hard to tell what was beneath the matts, urine soaked fur and filth.   Wrapped like a mummy in matts, this tiny creature struggled to get up, but was unable to walk. Bystanders called Animal Control.  RBARI got the call for immediate urgent rescue help.  This emaciated, sweet shih tzu was barely recognizable under a coating of thick, filthy fur.  He was unable to walk.  His matts wrapped around his head and limbs like a mummy.  He had matts at least 3 inches deep over his eyes, and the smell of urine and feces was overwhelming.  Weighing in at 6 pounds, he should have been 20 at a healthy weight.  He was weak and pale with horrible dental disease, yet all he wanted to do was find comfort through human touch.  


All you could see was his nose and tongue through the matts, and as he heard a kind voice, an amazing thing happened.  This sweet little creature moved towards us and gave kisses.  He was stumbling over from the weight of his matts and weakness of his body, yet he yearned to love and be loved.  We cuddled this beautiful forgiving soul despite the matts and smell, and we named him Grant, 

We immediately rushed Grant to Oradell Animal Hospital, as he was in distress and so weak.  His red blood cell count was low, and it dipped down even further in the first hours of his hospitalization.  Blood was found in his feces.  Grant was put in an IV and given a blood transfusion to stablize him.  He will have an ultrasound to determine if these symptoms are as a result of severe neglect or if there is more going on.  Our hope is that with 24 hour care and TLC, we can give Grant a second chance at life and that his body will respond positively.  

Grant remains loving - his faith in people remains steady as ours diminishes.  Help Grant learn about human kindness, and please help us give Grant the life that he deserves.

Help Frankie live a pain free life.,"Help Frankie live a better life! My brother and his family recently adopted this sweet girl from a shelter near the Houston, TX area. Once Frankie was situated in their home, they noticed she was moving strangely and acting like she was in pain. They took her to the vet where she as diagnosed with Bilateral Hip Dysplasia. This was not fully disclosed by the animal shelter prior to adoption. The shelter only stated that Frankie had a small hip issue that made her run funny like a bunny hop. Due to the severity of Frankie’s condition, she underwent Femoral Head Ostectomy surgery yesterday. This was a large, unexpected cost to my brother and his family but they felt it was the right thing to do. The other option was to return her to the shelter where she would likely be euthanized. Frankie is only about 1 year old and still has a lot of life and love to give. Once she recovers from surgery, she will need at least 6 weeks of physical therapy.

This pup was hit and left in the road by the driver (which is also illegal). She was seen by a vet and found to have a broken back left leg that will need a plate and/or pin to repair. It is broken in 3 places. She also bit through her tongue. The vet stabilized the leg and antibiotics and pain meds have been given until they can get her to an orthopedic surgeon on Monday. At this point, an orthopedic surgeon has not been found yet (being over the weekend) so once it is definite, the name will be given. An estimate from the vet said it will be a minimum of $3,500 for the surgery, not accounting for food, medication and possible therapy.

The positive thing is that the puppy is young enough that with the right care, she can live a normal life once healed. Please consider donating. Every single penny raised goes to her care.

The shelter is run by Ala and Lyndon, a compassionate Filipino couple raising their young family while managing two animal shelters that care for over 90 dogs and cats. Their daily work is an inspiring act of love and service, but they urgently need our help to continue.

Currently, the shelter is struggling with rising veterinary costs, limited funds, and the need for improved facilities. Many of the dogs they rescue arrive malnourished, injured, or suffering from preventable diseases. Your donation will go directly toward vaccinations, spaying/neutering, emergency surgeries, shelter maintenance, and daily food supplies. Even the smallest contribution makes a difference—every peso brings them closer to saving another life.",1749.0,2000.0,80.0,https://images.gofundme.com/iy9DDN7sJgwRrlFcpVulqh6Jn8I=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/92675469_1752757509131728_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-give-stray-dogs-in-moalboal-a-second-chance-at-life?qid=a3d3014d3624c7c20bb3187cd0a7e5a2,"Dog, Carnivores, Smile, Leisure, Canidae, Happiness, Toy dog, Vacation, Puppy, Child",1
Raise Money for a Local Animal Shelter For Valerie,"Hello,
i’m fundraising for Bolton Destitute Animal Shelter in honour of my Grandma Valerie. Valerie recently battled with liver cancer and although she gave a good fight she unfortunately passed away on the 21st of July. She cared for animals her whole life, from feeding the pigeons in her backyard for years, advocating to preserve the wildlife in horwich, lending a helping hand to every animal she can from bugs to deer to cats and dogs and rescuing and taking care of her own pets and animals including her 18 year old cat Leo who’s “the most well taken care of cat” the vet has seen and is still with us today. She would’ve loved to be able to give back to animals in need one last time and would love to support her community with that. We are asking for donations to our local animal shelter in Bolton in her honour. The destitute animal shelter have always gone above and beyond for the animals that need their help. They’ve provided homes for so many cats and dogs that need love and cared for them in any circumstance. They would benefit greatly from your help and it would be amazing to see my grandmas story motivate people to help. Anything will help and we appreciate it so much.",465.0,625.0,66.0,https://images.gofundme.com/1VH_Eo7SmWfiKzWHN4JYIJ-7SzQ=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93134943_1753738003636020_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/raise-money-for-a-local-animal-shelter-for-valerie?qid=7043aa8d406d10bc6b86365fab710493,"Dog, Collage, Pet Supply, Working animal, Canidae, Toy dog, Dog Supply, Kennel, Puppy, Screenshot",0
Support New Gates for Senatobia Animal Shelter,"Please help us.
My wife and I are volunteers at the Senatobia Tate County Animal Shelter. We have a deep love for these animals and try to help anyway we can. We are in desperate need of new gates on all of our kennels. Over the years, they have rusted out at the bottom. These gates have sharp edges on the bottom that have injured a couple of dogs that have tried to squeeze out under them.

This is a 40 bed shelter in rural northern Mississippi. The city and the county support the shelter, and they pay for food and half of spay and neuters, but they don't put a lot more than that into the upkeep of the building. This little shelter prides itself on ensuring that every single animal that leaves the shelter is spay or neutered before being adopted so that it doesn't add to the over population problem in the area. Volunteers fund raise for that and to improve the shelter any way they can.

Help Us Protect the Voiceless – Support Our Animal Shelter M,"Every day, countless innocent animals are left abandoned, hungry, scared, and forgotten.

We’re building that second chance.

Help the Beaverhead Animal Shelter,"Please help the Beaverhead Animal Shelter fight an alleged discrimination lawsuit!!

The Beaverhead Animal Shelter is being sued for an alleged discrimination. This lawsuit is a financial threat to the shelter and without help the shelter may have to close and the animals will have to find a place to go. Maybe somewhere that isn’t a no-kill shelter, somewhere they are not safe to find second chances they deserve. Please help us save the shelter. If you want to know more about this alleged discrimination and the lawsuit please call Susie at the shelter [phone redacted] or go visit her there. The shelter is located at 80 Lagoon Lane Dillon MT.

If anyone out there knows Susie you know that she is one of the least discriminatory people. She does not judge people on their race, gender, or whom they love. She cares about the animals, if they are taken care of and finding them the best homes. She cares about people and her employees as well. She has given money out of her own personal accounts to employees to help them with their bills and most of the time has never seen a dime back. She helps the public with free or low cost spay/neuter clinics, helping with vet care when they can’t afford it and she has given her friendship to these people.

Please don’t let this lawsuit be the end of an amazing shelter. Again if you have any questions call or visit Susie.

Animal Shelter in Need,"I’d like to introduce you to an amazing woman who has dedicated her life to saving abused and abandoned animals in Jarabacoa, Dominican Republic.  In 1995, Jacqueline Isaias’s founded Fundacion Salvavida, a non-profit foundation dedicated to rescuing animals in need. 

For the past 25 years, she has not only rescued hundreds of dogs but she has also taken in cats, horses and even cows. Today Jacqueline has 85 dogs, 20 cats, 3 horses and she has recently taken in 7 puppies to be adopted. 

I had the honor of meeting Jacqueline during my time living in the DR.  She is one of the most passionate, caring, selfless people I have ever met. She is hard working and hands on with all the animals she rescues.   Jacqueline’s property is located in the mountains of Jarabacoa. It can be described as an animal sanctuary that is approximately 4 acres of land, surrounded by fence and coconut trees, where the animals can roam freely. She has  even set-up automatic drinking water for the animals.

 Over the years, Jacqueline has rarely received donations of any kind.  As you could imagine the cost of running such a special place adds up very quickly.  Until recently Jacqueline has managed to keep the sanctuary going with her own money.  Her passion and dedication to saving the lives of these innocent animals has depleted nearly all of her resources.  Unfortunately, the situation has become critical and without your generosity and donations she is at risk of losing everything.

100% of the money donated will go directly to Jacqueline’s foundation to help cover the cost of shelter, food, and veterinary bills. 

If you are a dog lover, or just simply an animal lover we are asking you to please help in any way you can.  No amount is too small.

If you would like to meet the dogs and see some of the amazing work Jacqueline does please click on the video.

I started a fundraiser on Facebook, but it looks like they changed their formatting and it was a little bit difficult, which is why I've switched over to GoFundMe. I sincerely thank those who've donated through Facebook, but I'm now asking that going forward, you please donate through GoFundMe.

Help support Michelle Caron's Recovery,"Hi Everyone,

I am doing this GoFundMe on behalf of Michelle Caron. As most of us know, Michelle has dealt with diabetes for the majority of her life. She was fortunate to get a transplant years ago, and up until the past several years, she was going about her day-to-day life like most of us. However, several years ago, she had to get put on the transplant list again for a new kidney and has had to go to dialysis several times a week for several hours a day. Through all this, she continued to volunteer at the local animal shelter as well as get her degree in Business Administration.

Puppy Flight Sponsors Needed,"Hello, my name is Ashley, and I'm raising funds to transport stray and unwanted dogs and puppies from Nunavut to rescues and shelters in British Columbia and Newfoundland so they can find their forever homes.
All communities in Nunavut are fly-in only, and very few have animal shelters or even steady access to veterinary care. As a result, many communities have high numbers of stray dogs and unwanted litters. The unfortunate consequence of this is that many of these dogs, and even puppies, end up being euthanized.
For the past two years, since I moved to Nunavut, I have been working to save as many of these dogs as I can, sending them to rescues in Manitoba. I have taken in seventeen puppies and one adult dog so far this summer, and I will be taking in another litter of four puppies in the coming weeks once they are weaned. Now, due to the recent wildfires, all the rescues in Manitoba are full, creating another obstacle to give these dogs their second chance.",4200.0,4200.0,71.0,https://images.gofundme.com/iKVz79U1_US68lU4yA3UJt8OhJI=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/92975535_1753281906602602_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/puppy-flight-sponsors-needed?qid=44fddf1546ad54ab55343e8b2894382c,"Dog, Puppy, Carnivores, Vertebrate, Snout, Working animal, Toy dog, Canidae, Fur, Whiskers",1

ENGLISH:
There have been so many lovely stories in the US of all the animals in shelters getting adopted or fostered but unfortunately, it’s not the same case in Ecuador. A large part of the Ecuadorian population has always lived day by day, never knowing how much money they will make to feed themselves and their families. With the current situation we’re in regarding Covid-19, a lot of those people have not had the opportunity to go out and make some money. They are unable to feed their families, let alone their pets, which has led them to abandon their animals to fend for themselves. There are a lot of organizations helping these families, but not very many helping these animals.

In Quito, the capital city of Ecuador, a handful of shelters are working day and night to help these abandoned animals. These shelters are also providing low income families with food for their pets so they are able to keep them together.

Our goal with this fundraiser is to provide these shelters with the funds they need in order to keep their shelters going and so they can continue to help the community. We have been in contact with 3 local shelters:
Fundacion Lucky Bienestar Animal ()
Defensa de la Vida Animal Ecuador () 
Fundacion Camino a Casa ()
They are currently helping hundreds of animals that they have picked up over the last month and are rapidly running out of food and money for their vet bills.

The majority of the funds will be used to buy food for these shelters.  The rest of the money will be split evenly among the shelters to cover their day to day costs as well as the vet bills that have been piling up for the rescue animals.

$20 can help feed around 10 to 15 animals a day, so every little cent helps! Help us help those that are unable to help themselves!

ESPAÑOL:
Hemos leído sobre tantas historias increibles en los EE. UU. de todos los animales en los refugios que fueron adoptados o apadrinado, pero desafortunadamente, no es el mismo caso en el Ecuador. La mayoría de la población ecuatoriana siempre ha vivido día a día, sin saber cuánto dinero ganarán para alimentarse o alimentar a sus familias. Con la situación actual en que nos encontramos con Covid-19, muchas de esas familias no han tenido la oportunidad de salir y ganar un poco de dinero. No pueden alimentar a sus familias, y mucho menos a sus mascotas, lo que les ha llevado a abandonar a sus animales para valerse por sí mismos. Hay muchas organizaciones que ayudan a estas familias, pero no muchas que ayudan a estos animales.

En Quito, la capital de Ecuador, una cantidad limitada de refugios trabajan día y noche para ayudar a estos animales abandonados. Estos refugios también proporcionan a las familias de bajos ingresos alimentos para sus mascotas para que puedan mantener a estas familias unidas y cuidar de sus mascotas.

Nuestro objetivo con esta recaudación de fondos es proporcionar a estos refugios los fondos que necesitan para mantener sus refugios funcionando y que puedan continuar ayudando a la comunidad. Hemos estado en contacto con 3 refugios locales:
Fundacion Lucky Bienestar Animal () 
Defensa de la Vida Animal Ecuador () 
Fundacion Camino a Casa ()
Actualmente están ayudando a cientos de animales que han recogido durante el último mes y se están quedando rápidamente sin comida y dinero para cubrir los gastos del veterinario y tratamientos.

La mayoría de los fondos se usarán para comprar comida para estos refugios. El resto del dinero se dividirá en partes iguales entre los refugios para cubrir sus costos diarios, así como cubrir gastos de tratamientos y veterinarias que se han acumulado para los animales de rescate.

¡$20 puede alimentar de 10 a 15 animalitos por día, asi que cada centavo ayuda! ¡Ayúdenos a ayudar a aquellos que no pueden ayudarse a sí mismos!

Dog Shelter Construction - Sarajevo Strays,"Samra and Vedran run their own dog shelter for strays in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Banjo's Second Chance,"On the morning of July 1st, I stumbled upon an Instagram reel featuring Banjo--a doe-eyed, rambunctious doberman kenneled in the crowded Devore animal shelter. The caption explained that Banjo was in urgent need of rescue, as he was scheduled to be euthanized that afternoon at 2pm. Across Los Angeles and surrounding regions, the situation is dire: most shelters are exceeding capacity over 200%. This means that dogs surrendered by owners, the product of greedy backyard breeders, or the result of inadequate resources for spaying and neutering never get the opportunity to live full lives.

The comment section on Banjo's post was filled with pledges to contribute to his care, but as is understandable in these situations, there was difficulty in getting him out in time. As those who know me might be aware, I recently lost my soulmate rescue doberman, Charlie, to metastatic lung cancer in June. Charlie entered my life in October 2020--a stray from Inglewood, CA--and together we forged a bond that healed our respective souls. Though initially traumatized and shutdown, love and dedication enabled Charlie to blossom into a more confident dobie; her unconditional love left an indelible imprint on my heart.",1150.0,1200.0,77.0,https://images.gofundme.com/DqJwUvbDc7U9Q8SqTOzktnZ-nOc=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/92795157_1752780313466518_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/banjos-second-chance?qid=44fddf1546ad54ab55343e8b2894382c,"Dog, Carnivores, Vertebrate, Snout, Working animal, Canidae, Guard dog, Fur, Dobermann, Pet Supply",0

Support Team Starfish,"This is Starfish. She was abandoned at 10 weeks old on the beach in a Heineken box, unable to walk and splayed out on top of her food, like a starfish. Her body was flat, her organs were flat and the vet recommended euthanasia.

Team Starfish was able to harness her indomitable spirit and guide her recovery over the course of two months of physical rehabilitation.

She's had almost six active months on her feet and we've just read her Xrays again: she has extremely severe hip dysplasia. 
 
Team Starfish supports this dog. Our continuing partnership with the nonprofit --the wonderful shelter that rescued Starfish, believed in her, and brought her into our lives--will accelerate Starfish's medical care. – estimated to be $10,000.

Stand with Sherman: Donate for His Recovery,"Everyone — Sherman Needs Our Help!
This sweet boy was the victim of a freak accident at his foster home just two days ago. During a fully supervised play session, Sherman was injured by a larger foster sibling. What started as a normal part of his foster care — learning to socialize with other dogs — turned into a devastating moment in the blink of an eye.
Sherman’s upper and lower jaw were both destroyed in the incident, and he also suffered a severe leg fracture. He was rushed to El Paso Animal Emergency Center thanks to his foster mom’s immediate response, and that quick action gave him a fighting chance at life.
But Sherman cannot make it through this without help.",735.0,2800.0,57.0,https://images.gofundme.com/OUrN7SBRbDDf09d-bzEfMCvTxQ8=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93412667_175449305686530_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-with-sherman-donate-for-his-recovery?qid=af3e49b735550fdff740359f62fb040c,"Dog, Vertebrate, Carnivores, Snout, Working animal, Canidae, Puppy, Tail, Guard dog",0
Eleuthera Animal Shelter,"Hello friends!

As many of you know, myself along with a group of ""potcake warriors"" on Eleuthera are deeply committed to creating a shelter and suitable vet clinic. The plight of the ""potcake"" (or island dogs) is a heartbreaking one, and we have made it our mission to help alleviate their suffering by seeing this through! This dream has been talked about in earnest for over a decade, and the time is NOW!

We have WONDERFUL NEWS to share...

We have an almost too good to be true opportunity to purchase a 2 acre property for the shelter. It is the EXACT location where we have been holding small scale spay and neuter clinics. There is currently a restaurant adjacent to the makeshift clinic that could easily be converted into shelter facilities/a proper clinic/boarding or store front. The property has great visibility along Queens Hwy, is priced right, and checks all the boxes for our needs to jump start this program. In short, it is serendipitously PERFECT!!

Asking for help is not my nature, but our small group cannot do this alone! It takes a village! We don't have much time to gather the needed funds, but we are making a dent. Purchasing this property will give us the opportunity to expand upon our current efforts to alleviate these poor pups suffering, bring 21st century animal care to the island, and raise awareness about kindness to all beings!



This land purchase will set the wheels in motion!
From my whole heart we thank you in advance for anything you can spare.
With gratitude,
Lori Klinger and the girls on the front lines in Eleuthera (Erica, Ann, Sally and Holly)









Almost every out-island in the Bahamas has a facility of some sort to house and help manage the stray dog populations with the exception of Eleuthera. It's been talked about for far too long, and NOW is the time to come together and make this happen! The islands dogs, or ""POTCAKES"", face deplorable conditions on the island. They are born in the bush and many meet their fate as puppies on the highway. Others are considered complete nuisances by the locals and are drowned, poisoned, separated from their mothers to starve to death, or are dropped at the local dump to wait for burn day. Most that survive puppyhood are riddled with mange, heartworms, and other diseases due to malnutrition and their despicable living conditions :( It's a heartbreaking reality to face, horrifying in fact, but While we work to educate locals and continue the spay/neuter clinics, a shelter is badly needed to alleviate these inhumane conditions and to provide vets with an appropriate place to conduct necesasry medical procedures. We have identified the parcel of land, and once funds are in place, we will be able to build the shleter/clinic we have been talking about for over a decade. Unfortunately, HEART isn't enough to see this through, we need $$$ and EVERY dollar counts! Thank you in advance for your contribution. The small and scattered group of volunteers currently fostering pups and running up and down this 110 mile island cannot do this without YOU!

BREAKING NEWS - ANIMAL SHELTER BEING DEMOLISHED,"Hello everyone!

I am the founder of TAC -Together for Animas China. A small rescue for homeless and abused animals in Beijing and its surrounding areas.

Our organization relies solely on donations from animal-loving, compassionate people in China and abroad. To date, we have, with the help of GoldBond rescue in Oregon, successfully rescued over 1800 animals. Primarily dogs. And found them forever-loving homes abroad.

On November 1st, 2022, we received an official notice from the local government stating the building we occupy is deemed an illegal structure. And was given 10 days to move out or face eviction. And all animals will be terminated on site. Due the zero tolerance COVID policy in China, I have not been able to meet with any government officials because no one wants to have their Health Card turn Orange or Red if they unknowingly come close to anyone who might be positive. Even if they don't have any symptoms. And also because of the fear of having their Health ID card turning colors, they have not come to execute the notice. But it can happen anytime.

I have always had a deep love for animals since my childhood. Unfortunately, I’ve experienced the pain of losing many beloved animals due to diseases. One of the challenges we face in caring for animals, especially in rural areas, is the high cost of private veterinary medicines.

Help Build Our Town's Animal Shelter,"Mikayla is working to build a much-needed animal shelter in her small town, inspired by a heartbreaking experience at her school. After witnessing an injured and hungry dog abandoned in the school parking lot, Mikayla realized how urgently her community needs a safe haven for animals in distress. With no existing shelter nearby, many animals are left without care, food, or protection.

Mikayla is leading this project with the support of family, friends, and teachers, all coming together to make a difference for local animals. The team is still searching for the right location, but their commitment is strong. They know that building a shelter from the ground up means covering a wide range of expenses, from construction materials to food, bedding, and medical supplies.

Help animal shelter in India to save lives,"My name is Preeya and I live in the UK. In the UK I’ve rescued and rehabilitated homeless and wild animals for over two decades.

On my first trip to India in 2024, I witnessed the stray dog epidemic with my own eyes. This is like nothing I’ve ever seen before. These poor dogs are largely ignored by people and they suffer from disease, abuse, injury and malnourishment. I decided to always carry dog food with me to feed any stray dogs that I saw, because there should be no empty tummies. I also witnessed many stray cows rooting through trash just to find something to eat. There is unlikely to be food in the trash so they will eat plastic just to prevent their empty tummies from hurting.

Help Larla Rebuild After Apartment Fire,"My name is Larla, and I’m reaching out for support after a devastating apartment fire in Pocatello, Idaho that changed my life. While I was at work, a fire broke out in my home. The firefighters did everything they could, but I lost my three beloved cats—Leo, Timothy, and Shilo—to smoke inhalation. Leo was my brother’s cat, Timothy was my mother’s, and Shilo was my own rescue from the animal shelter. Losing them all at once was heartbreaking, especially since Timothy was my mother’s “baby” and caring for him was her last wish to me before she passed away four years ago. I had them cremated and hope to get urns for them when I’m able.


After the fire, my insurance company initially covered my hotel stay, but they recently stopped covering my displacement costs. Now, I need to find a new, pet-friendly one-bedroom apartment for myself and my new cat, Sage, who I adopted from the animal shelter. Sage has been a huge comfort to me, helping me cope with depression and the pain of losing my other cats. I work full-time locally, but the fire has made it difficult to keep up with daily life and expenses. I lost all my appliances and most of my furniture, including my bed.

SVAPL Animal Shelter Costs,"My name is Lisa and I'm the Shelter Manager at the Swan Valley Animal Protection League. We are located in Swan River, Manitoba Canada. The SVAPL has existed for approximately 25 years where the focus was on education and providing spay/neuter vouchers. The shelter/rescue work was established in 2009 and over the years it's grown to the point that we cannot continue without more financial aide. Since 2012 (when we started tracking) we have rescued 689 (to date) dogs and cats.

Although we do get some donations through fundraising, we are just unable to meet the financial needs that the shelter requires. In 2015, our adoption preparation costs were $19,733.00. This only includes animal vaccinations, spay/neuters and veterinary fees. This does NOT include utilities, dog/cat food, taxes, repairs & maintenance or any other kennel operation costs.

We are now appealing to the public for help in order to keep our shelter open and in good working condition. The money you donate will be used mainly toward our adoption preparation costs (spay/neuter/vaccination/vet fees). It will also be used to do repairs and upgrades on our outdoor kennels (we don't have indoor kennels) and perhaps give us enough to build a small dog housing area as we have no warm or dry places for small paws at our shelter.

With your help, tails will be wagging and purrs will be heard throughout the shelter. We will be able to continue rescuing unwanted, lost or abused animals throughout the Swan Valley, the surrounding areas and beyond. Thank you in advance for any amount you can give to us and know in your heart that you are helping at least one animal rest easy tonight in a warm and safe place until they find their forever home.",3759.0,5000.0,3340.0,https://images.gofundme.com/ry-2QBReNyFcTbV9dl1DYDz4ofo=/1200x900/https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/13625593_fb_1470854412.8004_funds.jpg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/svapl?qid=24b7fcc1b75d583a5827127644c1df23,"Dog, Cat, Carnivores, Vertebrate, Felinae, Felidae, Snout, Fur, Whiskers, Canidae",1

New Kennels for Garrard Co. Shelter,"The Garrard county animal shelter is a county-run shelter in rural Lancaster, Kentucky. We operate on a very small monthly budget that barely meets our operational needs to care for the dogs and cats in our shelter, let alone maintain the building or perform necessary upgrades and improvements to the kennels and our cat room.

In the past several months, in addition to consistently being at or over capacity, we have taken in animals from three hoarding cases, stretching our capacity and straining our ability to provide consistent resources for the animals under our care. We have had to resort to pleading for help from the community to step in and help numerous times, which they have, and we are so grateful!

We are raising money to rebuild the kennels in both our dog room and our puppy room. They are in desperate need of repair and we need your help. The kennels in our dog room are rusting, falling apart, and failing to contain dogs at times. This leads to break-outs, kennel fighting, and spread of sickness.

Each week we find another kennel's latching system no longer operational, leaving us with one less kennel in which to place an incoming dog. 

We have worked our way to becoming a no-kill shelter and are now nearly a year and a half euthenasia-free. We are extremely proud of this and the care that we are able to give to the pets in our facility, which makes the necessity for up-to-date, clean, working kennels such a huge priority for us. 

Our puppy room currently has no kennels at all and we are working with travelling crates and wire crates keep the puppies safe and secure. While these work most of the time, they are very difficult to keep clean and do not allow the puppies much room to move around. We are hoping to completely redo the puppy room by installing kennels in our puppy room that mirror that in our dog room. This will significantly cut down on the spread of very dangerous diseases and illness that puppies often carry.

Money donated will go directly toward the purchase of an entirely new kennel system with reinforced materials to prevent spread of sickness, prevent kennel fighting between kennels, and proper doors and latching systems to keep the animals safe and secure for both our dog room and the puppy room.

We plan to begin work on this project this summer and hope to have funding in place by June. Anything you can do to help is much appreciated!

MAR Y ARENA ANIMAL SHELTER TIJUANA,"Hi there and thank you for looking at out fundraiser campaign.

We are a of very motivated an passionate of individuals trying to raise funds for the maintenance of the animal shelter “Mar y Arena” located in Tijuana Mexico.

A little background, the person that takes care of this shelter is Adelaida, best known as Adelita. She is a 52 years old lady who works as a part timer teacher at a school on Tijuana. She uses all of the money she makes teaching at the school to take care of the shelter “Casa Hogar Mar y Arena A.C.”. She was recently diagnosed with brain Cancer, but that doesn’t stop her from taking care of the animals she loves, which most of them are homeless. Adelita sold her house seven years ago (When she started to take care of this shelter) to be able to take handle the expenses. Needless to say she’s has to make many sacrifices all through her life in order to continue with her life’s purpose. For this and many reasons we want to help her continue to carry on the help these dogs and animals so desperately need.


At the moment, Adelita takes care of over 200 dogs and some cats that she finds on the street. She lives in a little room located in the corner of the shelter, to avoid having housing expenses and have more resources for her shelter. She is not receiving any help from the government or any organizations public nor private. The only help she gets is from everyday citizens who donate food every once in a while, students who volunteer to clean the kennels, and one person who volunteers with her every two or three days. Adelita uses all of her money to take care of feeding the animals, treat them when they get sick, give them shots, housing and everything a shelter animal could need.

 

Putting Adelita’s animals for adoption is not an easy task. She has to take to be active in public adoption events. Every time she goes to a public adoption event (which happens twice a month), she is lucky if she gives away 2-5 animals for adoption with no fee. We have to keep in mind that she has to pay for all the expenses required to this events, like gas, parking, food, and anything that could be needed. Inviting people to her shelter hasn’t helped with adoption either, she noticed that the population at her shelter was increasing instead of decreasing. The reason for this is that instead of having a lot of people adopting animals, she started finding a lot of abandoned dogs in her front gate, so she had to stop giving the shelter’s address to people.
 

We are trying to help Adelita with a couple of areas around the shelter. One is the patio where we will put gravel as an area for the animals to pee and poop (225 m2), the other we will adorn with cobble to make it more presentable (225 m2.

In this same area there are drainage ducks that get overflown in the raining season, this causes the areas where the dogs rooms are to get flooded. We will raise the drainage and create a path for the water to flow to other areas and not affect the dog rooms.

Will waterproof the roofs of the bathrooms and other wooden areas, vanish the wood and add maintenance to the bathrooms.


We have a very small time frame to work with (2 weeks) for we would like to finish the patio area before the summer starts since the area gets plagued with ticks and fleas due to the dirt. The whole project is estimated to be $4000 USD. We are seeking your help to give these animals and Adelita the proper help they rightfully deserve. Anything helps, we will be posting photos of the progress.",1750.0,4000.0,2328.0,https://images.gofundme.com/tM744B4aoKqE1QLhZnlTFD3N8tI=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/39295984_1558288347667302_r.jpeg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/dog-shelter-tijuana?qid=c8c809e595ee1756937b94b8bd654c62,"Dog, Animal shelter, Cage, Mesh, Snout, Pet Supply, Carnivores, Working animal, Kennel, Dog Supply",1

Her dream is to regain her independence and return to the life she loves, including volunteering at the local animal shelter when she is able.

Celeste’s journey ahead is filled with new obstacles. She needs a handicapped accessible apartment, reliable transportation to dialysis and physical therapy, and specialized furniture like a temperpedic bed and an electric recliner to support her mobility. Medical equipment and devices will also be essential for her daily comfort and safety. While Celeste has a small family—her sister and a few relatives—she is surrounded by friends and colleagues who admire her resilience and kindness. Still, her greatest wish is to live independently, just as she did before her health took this turn.

Celeste has always been the first to help others in times of need, whether it’s supporting a friend through illness or loss, or simply sharing a laugh to lift someone’s spirits. Now, she needs her community’s support to create a safe, accessible home and to cover the costs of the medical care and equipment that will help her thrive. Every contribution will help Celeste move forward with hope, dignity, and the independence she deserves.",3245.0,6500.0,28.0,https://images.gofundme.com/ChZbduYvpAjfoXSX534gs9qMftc=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94315307_175700830558663_r.jpeg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-celeste-banners-road-to-independence?qid=a3d3014d3624c7c20bb3187cd0a7e5a2,"Dog, Carnivores, Smile, Vertebrate, Canidae, Working animal, Herding dog, Happiness, Border Collie, Australian Shepherd",1

Help Me Build Palestine’s Animal Shelter,"Dear Friends and Supporters,
My name is Dina from Palestine.
As Palestine endures the hardships of war, the toll extends beyond people – countless animals are left abandoned, injured, and vulnerable with nowhere to turn. In the face of such adversity, we are launching a vital initiative to build the very first animal shelter in Palestine. This shelter will serve as a sanctuary for animals in desperate need, providing them with safety, medical care, and the compassion they deserve.

Right now, there is no dedicated refuge for these animals, leaving them to fend for themselves in dangerous and unstable conditions.

Help Stray Kittens Get Vet Care,"Hello!

A few weeks ago, a mama cat (probably no more than a year old herself) turned up on a neighbor’s porch and had a litter of 6 kittens. My neighbor brought them in because it was during that last bunch of 90+ degree days, and I’m helping take care of them. They’re almost 4 weeks old now, have their own room, and everyone is doing well. Unfortunately, one of the kittens developed conjunctivitis (pink eye) and it’s spread to some of the other kittens.

We have already contacted Oregon Humane, Multnomah County Animal Shelter, and Cat Adoption Team, plus a couple of the veterinarian offices I’ve gone to with my own cats.

• Cynthia Stone (mother)

My family and I adopted her from an animal shelter in San Antonio about 9 years ago. Lily is the sweetest, most loyal companion. She loves going on walks, napping, and will eat anything and everything!

About 3 years ago, we noticed masses on her abdomen and sides. Over time, these masses began to grow and more began to appear. A couple of months ago, a small mass near her left armpit became ulcerated and has remained since. Because her open mass refuses to heal, Lily has been living with a plastic E-collar on so that she is not able to lick her wound, which prevents it from healing. Since Lily has had the E-collar on, her open mass still refuses to heal. After a trip to the veterinarian, we were told that she would need surgery to remove these masses of concern.",540.0,540.0,52.0,https://images.gofundme.com/crMspCh3pTADD809m0uUpk9wCP0=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93541235_1754922293185366_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/surgery-for-lily-jazmyns-loyal-friend?qid=af3e49b735550fdff740359f62fb040c,"Dog, Carnivores, Snout, Pet Supply, Dog collar, Collar, Car seat, Working animal, Dog Supply, Leash",0

Running for Ruger: Donate to Help Pets in Need,"Running for Ruger.

My name is Kristin Degnan and I’m running my first marathon in honor of my soul dog, Ruger, who crossed the rainbow bridge July 3, 2025. Ruger was an Australian Shepherd. I got him when I was 21 and we literally grew up together. He was, by far, the best dog I could have asked for. Ruger was smart, gentle, funny, loyal, patient, and sweet. He was my shadow, my best friend, and my adventure buddy for 11.5 wonderful years.

Ruger collapsed after a play session on July 1, 2025 and I rushed him to an emergency vet in Lynchburg, VA where they quickly pinpointed the issue. He had a significant amount of fluid around his heart that was preventing his heart from expanding normally. We went straight to Virginia Tech for an emergency cardiology consult. There, a dedicated team diagnosed the cause as a large mass on his right atrium, which was identified as angiosarcoma. In a matter of hours I went from living with my happy and healthy senior dog (who had just had recent blood work done and passed with flying colors), to my best friend having only days or weeks left to live as his body fought against this aggressive cancer. I chose to have the cardiology team remove the fluid from around his heart to make sure he was comfortable, so I could have a little bit of time to take him home, spoil him, and say goodbye to my best friend. He peacefully crossed the rainbow bridge 2 days later and I am now preparing to run the VA Beach Shamrock marathon in March of 2026 to honor Ruger and all the miles we walked/ran/traveled together.",2043.0,10500.0,70.0,https://images.gofundme.com/emGQweqUsuEmQVF720jkQUb9-10=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93007759_1753368208436471_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/running-for-ruger-donate-to-help-pets-in-need?qid=af3e49b735550fdff740359f62fb040c,"Dog, Carnivores, Snout, Herding dog, Fur, Canidae, Working animal, Border Collie, Australian Collie, Australian Shepherd",1

Unfortunately, things took a difficult turn almost immediately after adoption.

Within days, Jelly became lethargic, barely eating, and developed chronic diarrhea. She spends most of her time curled up in one spot, only getting up occasionally. I took her to the vet as soon as I could, and the visit revealed heartbreaking news: Jelly is showing signs of early kidney disease.

Banjo's Second Chance,"On the morning of July 1st, I stumbled upon an Instagram reel featuring Banjo--a doe-eyed, rambunctious doberman kenneled in the crowded Devore animal shelter. The caption explained that Banjo was in urgent need of rescue, as he was scheduled to be euthanized that afternoon at 2pm. Across Los Angeles and surrounding regions, the situation is dire: most shelters are exceeding capacity over 200%. This means that dogs surrendered by owners, the product of greedy backyard breeders, or the result of inadequate resources for spaying and neutering never get the opportunity to live full lives.

The comment section on Banjo's post was filled with pledges to contribute to his care, but as is understandable in these situations, there was difficulty in getting him out in time. As those who know me might be aware, I recently lost my soulmate rescue doberman, Charlie, to metastatic lung cancer in June. Charlie entered my life in October 2020--a stray from Inglewood, CA--and together we forged a bond that healed our respective souls. Though initially traumatized and shutdown, love and dedication enabled Charlie to blossom into a more confident dobie; her unconditional love left an indelible imprint on my heart.",1150.0,1200.0,77.0,https://images.gofundme.com/DqJwUvbDc7U9Q8SqTOzktnZ-nOc=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/92795157_1752780313466518_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/banjos-second-chance?qid=3e05da99384bba523046eac5ff850c53,"Dog, Carnivores, Vertebrate, Snout, Working animal, Canidae, Guard dog, Fur, Dobermann, Pet Supply",0
Animal shelters,"Fundraising for animal shelters is a critical endeavor that supports the welfare and well-being of countless animals. These shelters operate largely on donations and grants, which are essential for providing food, shelter, medical care, and rehabilitation services to animals in need. Effective fundraising strategies include online donation platforms, grant writing, corporate sponsorships, and community events such as adoption drives, charity auctions, and awareness campaigns.

The funds raised directly impact the quality of care that shelters can provide. Adequate funding ensures that animals receive proper veterinary attention, including vaccinations, surgeries, and treatments for illnesses. It also supports enrichment programs that improve the animals' mental and emotional health, making them more adoptable. Furthermore, fundraising efforts often extend to promoting adoption and responsible pet ownership, which helps reduce the number of animals in shelters.",,,129.0,https://images.gofundme.com/rh7am9VGLeC3heYc3R-77q0sypQ=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/91383745_1748295717329529_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/kyh5d-animal-shelters?qid=c2e790a0025e3c756508668b81bf49a7,"Dog, Animal shelter, Carnivores, Pet Supply, Mesh, Dog Supply, Kennel, Canidae, Cage, Fence",0
He Chose Us. Now We’re Fighting to Save Him,"Hello, my name is Scott, and I am trying to raise these funds for my cat, Ghost. Ghost has always been a pedestal to my family, from day one when we picked him up from the animal shelter. It sounds cringey, but Ghost was truly the cat that was meant to be for my family.

Something the shelter told us that always stuck with me is that Ghost hadn’t gone up to anyone prior to our family in the two weeks that he had been at the shelter. For some reason, he chose my wife, Angelina, after she laid next to him for a solid half hour. When we took him home, he immediately tailored a relationship with my other cat, Dom, who isn’t exactly the most friendly to other cats.

Help Launch Minions Utopia Animal Shelter,"My daughter and I have always felt a calling to help animals in need. Living near a park, we often find cats and dogs that have been left behind, as well as the occasional family of possums, skunks, or raccoons. We make sure every animal that comes our way has food, water, and a safe place to stay. Over time, we’ve become a lifeline for many animals who have nowhere else to go.

Our biggest challenge is making sure these animals get the veterinary care they deserve. Many need check-ups, vaccinations, and spay or neuter procedures, but the costs are overwhelming. With food prices rising and more animals needing help, it’s become harder to keep up with their needs.

That big belly is an aggressive tumor called hemangiosarcoma. While waiting for pending oncology appointments, this mass doubled in less than a month. When I came home last Monday she was not at the door to greet me. I found her panting heavily and unable to move. Rushed her to a veterinary ER, who said she had lost half her blood volume into her tumor (she likely struggled to follow me to my doctors appt over her gate). After stabilized with pain control and blood transfusions, the surgeons at MedVet removed a 22 lb. tumor from her abdomen. Unfortunately, they found numerous bleeding nodules that had spread through the liver as well. She is being evaluated by oncology and they are developing a care plan, but her prognosis isn't good. She still has a joy for life, especially in her toys and femur bones, and finally regained her vacuum-cleaner appetite post-op.

Help 20 Urgent Cats on their journey to rescue,"Just a week ago, twenty cats were living in a trailer facing eviction outdoors with threats of poisoning by neighbors.  And, today, with your support, they have hope thanks to an innovative partnership between rescuers, the Ramapo-Bergen Animal Refuge, Inc and two New England shelters with a demand for adoptable cats.  With your support for their medical care and transport, together we can immediately save TWENTY lives and kick-start this lifesaving collaboration as we send these cats on a special journey to their forever homes. 

The owner of these cats had fallen ill, lived without hot water, spent her last dollar to care for and feed the cats she had rescued from outside, and her trailer was days away from being condemned.  She had called and emailed countless rescues for years with no reply.  But, when she called RBARI, we answered and immediately took the trip to New York to see how we could help. 

What we saw was heartbreaking.  The home was clean, and these cats were obviously loved and cared for, but twenty cats within a trailer that structurally was falling apart was too much for her to handle, both physically and financially.  Over the years, these cats had shown up at her door in need, and she had done her very best to care for them and provide medical care, despite being on disability due to chronic illness from lupus.  She spent her last dollar on cat food, spay / neuter and their care.  She was desperate to help these cats, many of which needed medical attention that love just couldn’t fix and was beyond her means. 

 
We knew we had to help, and we knew time was limited.  Amazingly, we had just signed on to a partnership with two New England rescues / shelters, one in Maine and one in Vermont.  They have a shortage of adoptable cats – an incredible and almost unfathomable dream come true for so many cats in desperate need.  Sadly, we live in an area where cats lose their lives daily for sheer lack of space, so we quickly mobilized to secure this partnership.  Our goal was to immediately rescue cats in our community and in kill shelters that had no place to go.  This partnership could not have come at a better time for these twenty cats.  Without this option for placement, RBARI would have been unable to accommodate them all, but with this opportunity and collaboration with local rescues, we can now help ALL TWENTY CATS!



TIME IS LIMITED for these cats.  They need to be out of the trailer by the end of the week, at which time, the weather will warm up, the septic will back up, the electric is being turned off and their home will be condemned by the health department, rendering them all homeless.  Please make a donation to help us save these cats and provide them with the medical care, daily care and transport along their journey to a new life.


Your donation today will help us to save these beautiful cats, as well as initiate a program that will save homeless cats in our community and in local kill shelters that will otherwise face euthanasia.

Building an Animal Shelter on Malapascua! Ep. 2,"Continuing to Save the Cats and Dogs! The Saga Continues....


THE STORY
In April, lots of very generous people helped us achieve our goal of $10,000 to start an animal shelter in Malapascua Island, Cebu, Philippines. You can find out more info about that amazing campaign and more about the beginning of the shelter, here https://www.gofundme.com/f/malapascua-paw-heroes.



We are running low on funds! If we do, the shelter will have to close, releasing all those strays back to the streets where they likely won’t survive. This will also take away jobs from our staff, and the locals we buy fish for the animals from, and shut down the vet assistance we provide the island. 

Please help us achieve our goal of making Malapascua a stray-free island by treating and spaying/neutering all of the sick/stray dogs and cats to control the population and eradicate disease and sickness which can also be spread to the residents.


Established a  shelter located in the North of Malapascua

Over the last few months, we’ve taken in and housed more than 40 stray dogs and 20+ cats. We’ve had them treated for mange and other illnesses, kept them fed and safe, had them vaccinated and spayed/neutered, and adopted by us or others.

We have also assisted pet owners with 50+ dogs and 30+ cats - from providing advice, medicine, or helping them receive vet care. 

We have vaccinated all our rescues, and treated 14 cases of Distemper successfully, lost 2. Treated 4 cases of Parvovirus successfully, lost 1. Treated 23 kittens for Ameoba. These are severe illnesses that cause many deaths every year if left untreated. 

Here are some of the fur babies we've saved and continue to help!:

Bandit! He had to have chemotherapy and is now the head of the welcome group at the shelter :)


Pacca - before and after. She had bad mange, but is now recovering!


Building the kitty houses! 


Indoor Kitty play room

Tempeh - one of the first rescues! 


 

Since the last fundraising round we have been busy! We signed a lease on a small house with a big garden for the dogs and cats to run around in! We had to repair a huuuuuuge concrete fence, clean up the garden, install plumbing and electrical, buy water pumps,, and buy lots of doggie and kitty stuff like cages, soap/shampoo, medicines, bowls, baby bottles, and lots of other fun stuff!

The construction and setup of the house took more funding than we anticipated and since then we have been spending money on food for the animals, staff, medical supplies for the animals, and of course our monthly rent and other expenses like electricity. 





PROVIDE URGENT VETERINARY CARE
We arrange transport for the animals to the local vet clinic in the mainland, and organize monthly visits from vets from the mainland to perform spay/neutering, vaccines, and other surgery we cannot handle on our own.


PROVIDE DAILY CARE
Basic medicines, baths, food, water, and love from our team of volunteers, visitors, and staff


EDUCATION
We hope that by just having the shelter, it will bring more awareness of the problem with sick animals on the island. We have had some school kids in to visit and just play with the animals to try and build those bonds! We also plan to  visit local schools and homes to educate the local population on how to love fur babies and how to care for them. We have been providing advice and access to medicine to any local pet owners to help them keep their pets healthy and happy.





We are a small permanent team supported by a large network of international volunteers and local community partners. Each one of us is willing to share our time and love to support the animals of Malapascua. Gina De Ruyter, the co-founder and project-champion of MPH, oversees operations with volunteers and day-to-day activity. Gina has training and experience working in veterinary clinics and volunteering in shelters all over the world.  She is currently out of action due to breaking her leg at the shelter. She is advising staff from afar to ensure smooth operating.



Our main man, is originally from the mainland Cebu, but offered his services to come over and help take care of the shelter and the animals when Gina was injured. He has been holding the shelter together and making sure the animals are getting fed and loved! Here’s to Joe! Thanks Joe!


And some of you may know Lee Gallant, who is one of the co-founders of this shelter and helped bring it to life during the first big fundraising push in April! He works behind the scenes on mostly budget controls, and making sure the bills get paid, planning for future activities with Gina, and making sure the shelter has a future :) You may recognize this shot, below from the live concert we hosted from the beach last April. Maybe another one coming soon!




At this current moment we do not have any volunteers due to the world pandemic. We look forward to a future where volunteers can assist us to expand our work, capturing more strays to be treated and cared for. Until then, our limited staff  is taking care of our current rescues and any additions that get dropped off to us. 





✪ Paying rent for our rescue shelter, which currently houses 16 dogs and 15 cats. Needed 15,000 PHP/month

✪ Arranging a Spay and Neuter campaign for the island, using volunteer vets to sterilise and vaccinate as many strays and pets as possible. This will run over a couple of days, twice yearly.  A single vet mission costs around 50,000PHP. 

✪ Medicines to treat issues such as mange, distemper, parvovirus, fleas, ticks, worms and amoeba. After initial stock, we can maintain for around 2,000PHP/month.

✪ Emergency transport of animals and vets to and from the island for vet visits. This is mainly done when we have an animal due to be sterilised, sick or needs vaccinating.

✪ Information microchips to be implanted into each dog in order to track their medical records. This will be done for strays that have to be released, once the shelter is at max capacity. 

✪ Payment for support staff food and accommodations. This can add up as we need to keep the house and yard in order, and our staff looked after. This can be a few thousand pesos per month. 

We hope that we can raise enough funds to last us another year, so the good part of 2021. That means we need around 400,000 PHP to sustain all of these costs, plus two annual vet missions with a cost of 100,000 PHP total, bringing us to 500,000 PHP or $13,500 CAD

Animal Shelter in Memory of Irene,"Irene Chevalier was the mother of 9 children to the husband in the military.    We were surround by a lot of love and candidly great chaos.   Pets were always an important part of our lives and taught us a lot about life.

In Irene's retirement years she volunteered tirelessly for over 10 years the Calhoun County animal shelter where one her daughter's Kathleen is on the board of directors.   She volunteered over 10,000 hours during those years working at the thrift store that was a critical source of funds.    She also fostered dogs during their transition and helped transport them to their new homes.  While during her life she had many pets she left behind a rescue name Paris who now lives and is loved by Kathleen.


We recently lost Irene but heaven gained another angel and my father got his bride again.  She will be buried alongside her husband Leo and first daughter Carol in August at Arlington Cemetery.

In lieu of flowers we are asking for a donation to the animal shelter as that would bring a great smile to Irene and all of her children.    She would be thrilled to see these funds go directly to helping these incredible cats and dogs that have had a rough start in life to get a better one.

100% of the funds will go to this animal shelter which helps board, feed, vaccinate, neutered/spayed and ensure these wonderful pets get a great new home.

Urgent Help for LA’s Animal Shelters due to Wildfires,"Hi, I’m Vera. My current home—Los Angeles—is burning to the ground. The recent fires have caused unimaginable destruction: so many people have lost their homes, and countless animals have been displaced or injured.

It’s heartbreaking to see how overwhelmed local shelters are right now. Many are operating at full capacity, taking in pets lost during evacuations and providing urgent medical care to injured wildlife.

Poppy has FPV,"I am raising funds for our 8 year old cat’s care at the emergency vet.

She is the best cat to our 5 year old daughter and her best friend. Anyone who knows our daughter also knows who Poppy is!

Two weeks ago we applied to foster to adopt a kitten from the Shelbyville Animal Shelter. Five days later we learned that a cat at the shelter had tested positive for Feline Panleukopenia, sometimes called feline parvo. We were told to keep a close eye on our kitten and keep the cats separated (a hard job but one we did our best on). Our kitten seemed okay for a while but on Friday (9/5) our kitten suddenly got very sick and needed to be put down. Immediately we suspected FPV and took every measure to protect our Poppy who hadn’t been vaccinated against FPV in a few years. We got Poppy an emergency vaccination two days ago to help build her antibodies in case she was exposed. Today (Wednesday 9/10) Poppy has been acting off and had to be rushed to the emergency vet. The costs to just look at her and give her a diagnosis are already more than we can afford, and she has now been diagnosed with the deadly disease of FPV.

Support New Beginnings Animal Shelter,"Our purpose is to raise funds for materials and labor to construct a new cat patio and a dog run at the New Beginnings Animals Shelter in Belize. On a recent visit to Belize, Susan Kosoris (past VP of the Ellis Co., TX SPCA) and I learned that there are no government-supported animal shelters in Belize. But there is a small private shelter - the only one in the country for BOTH dogs and cats, run by Luz Hunter, a respected naturalist/tour guide in Belize that we know well. She maintains the shelter, making sure that discarded or unwanted pets are given a safe place to live out their lives. She tries to find homes for adoptable animals. The shelter is rustic - outdoor spaces made of donated materials. Luz ensures that all animals are neutered, get vaccines, are given excellent medical care, and are fed. There is no funding source. Although there are a few donations from Belize and elsewhere, the money goes directly for food and medical care and there is rarely enough left for improved facilities. Susan and I visited the shelter and met some of the animals, like Pinkie, pictured here. We hope you might be interested in helping. Is this shelter more important than your local shelter? No. But even $10 will go a long way in Belize to help these dogs and cats live safe and happy lives. Any amount is appreciated and will be used carefully.

UPDATE! Support Little Boy's Emergency Care,"Update*
Our family is finding ourselves in a position to save our cat, Little Boy. It’s hard to ask for help, and we’ve never been in this position to even ask. Anything will help as we watch the emergency vet bill climb. Little Boy is full of spunk and love, and we can’t imagine losing him. He is being hospitalized at Newton Animal Hospital. If there is money left over, it will be donated to a local animal shelter/hospital.
*Little Boy is coming home! This morning the vet had informed us he was responding to the medicine and treatment getting better quicker than expected. The vet had found a bot fly larva in his cheek/upper neck later in the day when he was doing well enough to have a full checkup. This was causing him to have a very high fever and inflammation/infection. The donation total has been lowered to the actual bill from the vet.",226.0,2600.0,31.0,https://images.gofundme.com/TqTDHjlBZOyvJg8FX1jRXxhnv4Q=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94201559_1756743065453423_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-little-boys-emergency-care?qid=db1df4815572813bdc727e97ce0d912e,"Cat, Felidae, Felinae, Carnivores, Whiskers, Snout, Fur, Domestic short-haired cat, Paw, Tail",0

Even at 8 years old, he has always been an energetic, active dog and his change in behavior was alarming.

We worked with the vet to try to narrow down the cause as more issues kept popping up - after some blood testing they found that his hormone levels were very low and he had begun hormone therapy and a new diet in June.

Two weeks ago, his health deteriorated and after two visits to the vet, blood testing, x-rays and an ultrasound, we were distraught to discover that Tug has Lymphoma in his small intestine that has progressed to where they don't think he has much time left. At this point, the lymphoma is prevalent in his intestine and has caused inflammation in all of his digestive organs surrounding it to where he is unable to process food as normal. Knowing this now, we think he may have been suffering with this for a few years as he has often had random bouts of GI distress and a weakened immune system.",1815.0,2000.0,30.0,https://images.gofundme.com/MwKQl64f_sh-0U54IEu7f9BviAM=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94220951_1756770651206818_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-tugs-comfort-and-care?qid=44fddf1546ad54ab55343e8b2894382c,"Dog, Carnivores, Black, Snout, Canidae, Geological formation, Collar, Outcrop, Dog collar, Ancient dog breeds",1

Support to Cover Medical Recovery During Charity Work,"Hello. Let me tell you the story of how this happened. I've been helping out my local county animal shelter. They give me dog food to feed my neighbor's dogs. He's a hoarder and can't afford to feed them all. The food helps to keep the dogs fed till the shelters have room. One day, while feeding them, this puppy came over so excited he did a little jump and a wiggle. The scene was so cute I wanted to show my husband. I got inside, jumped off the floor, and came back down, breaking my foot, ankle, and wrist. I'm going to be out of work for at least 3 months in all.

It's scary to think someone was capable of such an act, but I think it's very important that we find who did this before they find their next victim. My cat was taken, brutally murdered, and cleanly cut in half, and half of her was returned to be found. The possibility of it being an animal or a vehicle was ruled out by close inspection by a veterinarian and employees.

Donate to in memory of Forest: help local animal shelters,"On August 31, 2025, my life was forever changed. My family’s 14-year-old semi-blind dog named Forest — a beloved companion — tragically passed away after being struck by my boyfriend’s car as we were pulling into the gate during heavy rain. The car was moving slowly, and at first the dog was at the side of the vehicle. But in an unpredictable moment, he moved underneath and was struck by the back wheel.

He cried out in pain, unable to stand, his hip, spine, and paw injured. In tears, I wrapped him in towels and rushed him home. As his condition worsened, we took him to the vet. The vet administered pain medication, examined him carefully, and gently explained that euthanasia was the most humane option. With a shattered heart, I agreed, not wanting him to suffer further.",30.0,1800.0,26.0,https://images.gofundme.com/ozgLuSZQHRrKgqvL5ffq2qXNfZI=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94391869_1757193693988959_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/donate-to-in-memory-of-forest-help-local-animal-shelters?qid=7043aa8d406d10bc6b86365fab710493,"Dog, Comfort, Carnivores, Child, Canidae, Toddler, Bedding, Bed sheet, Linens, Lap",0

The preferred dog bed at RASKC is a Kuranda, which is elevated and chew-proof. Beds are approximately $145-165 each depending on size, but deeper discounts are available for bulk purchases.

Animal Shelter Christmas – Sharing Love and a Meal,"Hi, I’m Nethan. I’ve always had a soft spot for animals, and I’ve been involved in charity work to help them for as long as I can remember. Growing up, I hated seeing homeless animals on the streets and pets that were abandoned, left without love, food, or a place to call home.

It’s heartbreaking to think about how helpless they are. As humans, we can speak up when we’re hurt, hungry, or in trouble. But these poor creatures can’t. All they can do is wag their tails in hope or curl up in a corner, waiting for someone to care.

Christmas is a time of joy, love, and giving. While we enjoy the season with our families and delicious meals, let’s not forget the animals that share this world with us. They deserve love too.",,,287.0,https://images.gofundme.com/MBtaTUq1u2YDoXDyb3LpVhB4IYI=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/85142593_1734668548148854_r.jpeg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/animal-shelter-christmas-sharing-love-and-a-meal?qid=211fa9539295554b7e876e9689efa583,"Carnivores, Felinae, Felidae, Cat, Winter, Snout, Dog, Fur, Canidae, Snow",0

Hilf unserem kleinen Spock wieder frei atmen zu können,"Hallo, mein Name ist Wanjuscha. Gemeinsam mit meinem Mann, meinen zwei Kindern und unseren beiden Katzen Spock und Fofoinha möchte ich euch unsere Geschichte erzählen.
Im Oktober 2024 haben wir Fofoinha in Portugal von der Straße gerettet, nachdem ihre Mutter sie zurückgelassen hatte. Damit sie nicht alleine ist, haben wir im April 2025 Spock aus dem Tierheim zu uns geholt. Von der ersten Minute an waren die beiden unzertrennlich.
Doch kurze Zeit später begannen die Sorgen: Spock bekam große Probleme beim Atmen. Er kann nicht richtig mauzen, kaum schnurren und schläft fast nur noch auf dem Rücken, weil er sonst keine Luft bekommt. Selbst so schnarcht er ständig, verschluckt sich oder hat kleine Atemaussetzer. Es bricht uns jedes Mal das Herz, ihn so zu sehen.
Unsere Tierärztin überwies uns an die HNO-Abteilung der Kleintierklinik Leipzig. Nur unter Narkose kann festgestellt werden, was ihm genau fehlt – und wahrscheinlich wird direkt eine Operation notwendig sein. Die Kosten dafür belaufen sich auf 3.000 bis 4.000 €.

For the past seven years, I’ve been the primary caregiver for my grandmother, Loretta. She was more than just family — she was my heart, my constant, and someone I devoted myself to fully. I accompanied her to every medical appointment, tended to her daily needs, and did everything I could to ensure she was safe, cared for, and never alone through her many physical health challenges.

Loretta passed away recently, and while she did have a small insurance policy, it unfortunately only covers half of her funeral expenses.

GARD Animal Shelter Expansion,"Hello GARD Supporter!

Thank you for being a continual supporter of GARD.  All of your generosity thus far has been greatly appreciated by us and the animals that you have helped save!

We hope that you can help us on our next endeavor.  Our shelter is packed to the capacity with many animals who are deemed “unadoptable” due to behavioral issues.  As you are aware we are a no-kill shelter which we are very proud of but at this time we have hit a point where we need more space to save more lives.

There is a piece of property located next door to the GARD shelter which we have been desperately attempting to purchase.  Unfortunately, we have been hitting road blocks at every corner.  We have recently been able to reach an agreement with the owner and we are trying to raise as much money as we can to purchase this property so we can grow our organization. Because of the continuous financial burdens of running a shelter, we have not been successful with gathering the funding we need.

We are hoping and praying that you or someone you know may be able to help us.  The property already has a building on it which we plan to use for our administrative offices, our meet and greet location for potential adopters, an indoor cat room as well as an indoor puppy room. There will also be more land for sanctuary areas and play yards.



With great regret, we cannot enter into this endeavor without much help from generous people like you! 

Can you help us?  Do you know others who can help? 

Please, we are desperate for your help!  If you can donate anything at all to help us purchase this property, the animals that we will be able to continue to save will be eternally grateful!

Thank you for your consideration and continued support!",,,2897.0,,https://www.gofundme.com/f/gard-expansion?qid=ddf8620626e07595da539a804bd34b9a,No image URL,0

Donate to Penelope's Upcoming Surgery,"About a month or two ago, my beloved 9-year-old cat, Penelope, developed a firm lump on her right hip.

The surgeon suspects the lump is a fibrosarcoma and recommends an excisional biopsy and histopathology for a definitive diagnosis with an oncology follow-up. This little girl is so special as she doesn't realize she is a tortie and has no ounce of sass or spiciness infamously known in tortoiseshell cats.

Emergency Surgery for Michelle's St Bernard,"Hello, my name is Michelle and I hate to do this but I’m asking for help with my beloved st Bernard’s vet bill. He needs surgery to remove a foreign object stuck in him. He is so loved my myself and my 2 children. I am a single mom with 2 kids and I work at an animal shelter.

Help Southside Rebuild After Fire,"In the early morning hours of February 13th, around 1 am, our barn was engulfed in flames. We are so thankful that a truck driver happened to be passing by and alerted authorities. Firefighters were able to get the fire put out before it spread too far into other buildings, but we lost everything inside. The barn had all of our donated items, our dish room, laundry room, and many other valuable items. The barn was also the home base for our feral cat colony, who have not all been accounted for yet. Not only was the barn lost, but all of the buildings on our property sustained either fire, smoke, or significant water damage as well. In addition, several of our outdoor kennels, much of our fencing, and our feral catio were destroyed. The loss is incredible, and we are devasted. It will take us months, and thousands of dollars to recover.

Help us Donate to Animal Shelter for Stray Cats,"We rescued a stray kitty off the cold, wet streets of Seattle in December. She was in bad shape with fleas and mites, and had a swollen belly. After a few square meals and a warm, safe night in our garage, we took her to emergency vet care, who determined she had no owner registered on her microchip. Unfortunately, they also told us that she was in severe condition and needed more help than we could provide.

The vet's office was partnered with the Seattle Animal Shelter, and on our agreement to surrender the cat to their care, her case was going to be handled by them. We knew that would be the best chance for her to have a comfortable place to live out the rest of her days, few as they might be.

We know the likelihood of a senior, sick cat being put up for adoption is low, and I only wish I could personally do more for our sick and senior animal friends. I am so grateful to the community of animal caregivers and would like to make a contribution to their efforts.

Puppy Flight Sponsors Needed,"Hello, my name is Ashley, and I'm raising funds to transport stray and unwanted dogs and puppies from Nunavut to rescues and shelters in British Columbia and Newfoundland so they can find their forever homes.
All communities in Nunavut are fly-in only, and very few have animal shelters or even steady access to veterinary care. As a result, many communities have high numbers of stray dogs and unwanted litters. The unfortunate consequence of this is that many of these dogs, and even puppies, end up being euthanized.
For the past two years, since I moved to Nunavut, I have been working to save as many of these dogs as I can, sending them to rescues in Manitoba. I have taken in seventeen puppies and one adult dog so far this summer, and I will be taking in another litter of four puppies in the coming weeks once they are weaned. Now, due to the recent wildfires, all the rescues in Manitoba are full, creating another obstacle to give these dogs their second chance.",4200.0,4200.0,71.0,https://images.gofundme.com/iKVz79U1_US68lU4yA3UJt8OhJI=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/92975535_1753281906602602_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/puppy-flight-sponsors-needed?qid=b7bb97e73049109cac4a80eaef1ddecc,"Dog, Puppy, Carnivores, Vertebrate, Snout, Working animal, Toy dog, Canidae, Fur, Whiskers",1
Walking 1200 Miles To Build An Animal Sanctuary,"Ever since I can remember, I have loved animals.

When I was a child in elementary school, the teacher asked the class to draw a picture of what we wanted to be when we grew up. Of course, there were doctors, fire fighters, astronauts, etc., but I drew something different. I drew a picture of myself in a convertible, with a dog, driving towards trees and a body of water.
When asked what it was, I said, ""When I grow up, I'm going to hop in a car with my (future) dog. We will drive until we run out of gas, and there we will live, and have a great time meeting other people and animals."" 
Of course I had no concept of how far a full tank of gas could take you, but moral of the story--

    Over the years now, my vision has not changed that much. More or so it has evolved into something bigger, better, and with more impact.
    You see, over time, I began to see visions of myself in a large area walking with multiple dogs around me.
I simply thought to myself, ""John, you know you want to own more than one dog, but what about owning multiple dogs?"" No big deal, right?
     Continue even further, that vision continued to play in my mind as I have grown, and has developed into more of a compassionate element. I have a strong desire to help animals. It feels as a calling to help all animals (dogs, cats, etc.), especially those who had no one else to rely on.  Specifically, animals with special needs/ medical issues, under hospice care, behavioral issues, or older animals that no one wanted to adopt because they are deemed to not have much time left to actually live.
I thought to myself, ""Maybe one day I can have enough land to have a little 'farm' consisting of rescuing animals who deserve unconditional love they may never experience.  A place where they can come live out their last years, and be well-taken care of, loved and provided for.""

    I have been searching for ways to help animals and within the last handful of years through volunteering at animal local shelters. I finally got to express that gift of helping animals, and experienced the unconditional love that animals have for humans. There is no greater feeling than to take care of an animal from a poor situation (neglect, abused, abandoned, etc.), and then see that same animal get adopted. Just to be able to witness the joy it brings to a child, a veteran suffering from PTSD, a single mother, a family of 7, etc. I soon realized how much fulfillment I get from being a part of this process, caring for the animals, and helping them to become the best versions of themselves by rehabilitating them with love, direction, and a sense of purpose. 

So here I am now, at age 33 years, and my vision has come full circle. I finally know what my vision has been and what my mission needs to be...

An amazing part about this, is that my wife shares this passion, love, and dream of helping animals too. We are a family on a mission (to say the least). 

Now let me be the first to say that I understand that this is a massive undertaking. It is something that weighs heavy on my heart because I know the amount of work, money, volunteers, etc. that is required to create and operate this vision I have and make it a success come true.

As many people may know, animal shelters are primarily funded by grants, fundraisers, donations, etc. The point is, it is extremely difficult to maintain the finances needed to fund such amazing facilities, the people who staff them, and the materials required for all of the animals year round.  

And that is why we need . 
We are reaching out to for help.

In order to create something so special and dear to us, we need your donations. We need your help. The animals need your help.

With this being said, . I genuinely want to show you how important this dream really is to me. I want to literally EARN your donations. 


It is taking place in North Park, Pittsburgh, PA.
That means I will be averaging ~30 miles a day, every day, for ~40 days straight. This is a serious undertaking and a challenge that will tax me mentally and physically. I will be doing this journey alone, without any outside help.  

As you read this I'm currently walking. 
The journey has begun!!

I will be keeping everyone up to date via social media:

Again, my hopes are that you feel and share my passion for the animals I want to help, and I hope my effort walking 1200 miles will earn your support.

Save Macy's Life: Urgent Heart Surgery Needed,"I am raising funds to save my shelter dog, Macy's life. I adopted Macy on June 17, 2025 from the Tehama County Animal Shelter. She had kennel cough twice when she was in the shelter. She also had giardia. The cardiologist says she needs a heart surgery that costs $10,000. She was born with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Insurance will not cover the cost because she was born with the condition. Her life expectancy is approximately one year if she doesn't receive the surgery. Since she is already 7 months old, she needs the surgery soon. if the surgery is successful, she will have a nearly normal life expectancy.
Despite her health issues, Macy has a ton of energy. She had chewed many items in the house, and she runs her zoomies everyday. Hopefully we get the surgery done before any heart damage occurs.
Macy is the perfect addition to our family, my other dog, Abby is so happy to have Macy. We love Macy, and the thought of losing her is unbearable.

George my 4 year old autistic son was mauled by a dog,"Help George Heal After a Traumatic Dog Attack

My name is [Colby barker], and I’m asking for your help for someone incredibly special—my son, George Barker.

A day ago, our lives were turned upside down when George was viciously mauled by a rescued dog from the noble animal shelter where we were repeatedly lied to about the dogs temperament and now need funding for a lawyer and medical bills and therapy.

TLC animal shelter and rescue animals have been a big part my life since I was little. All of our animals are rescues and my family fosters homeless cats.

Many people bring potential new family member out there to visit with them. Lastly I will be tearing down and removing an old shed back behind the shelter.

Support Calvin's Cupboard: Feed Pets in Need,"Hi all! My name is Lee and I’m launching Calvin’s Cupboard, a mobile pet pantry named after my dog Calvin.

Too many families in Northwest Arkansas face the impossible choice between feeding themselves and feeding their pets. A partial look into local surrender data indicates that nearly 1 in 10 animal surrenders in NWA are due to financial hardship. This comes from a very small set of data and the actual number is likely much larger.

I have first hand experience working in local animal shelters, where I have helped people through the very difficult decision to surrender their pet due to financial circumstances, very often out of their control. Getting help with pet food can often mean the pet can stay with their people, out of the shelter. This allows our local shelters to focus on animals that do not already have a home where they are loved.",1220.0,1000.0,8.0,https://images.gofundme.com/qU7B2yIlZZFOGpFu1kbO7FVedOk=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94822685_1758348342354166_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-calvins-cupboard-feed-pets-in-need?qid=44fddf1546ad54ab55343e8b2894382c,"Snout, Graphics, Canidae",0
Help Lana Recover and Find a Home,"Lana is a six-month-old puppy from Miami Dade Animal Shelter. I rescued her from the euthanasia list, and she’s now facing a tough battle with pneumonia. I’m still searching for a rescue to intake her but haven’t had any rescue able too. Lana has been struggling with nasal discharge, coughing, and lethargy. Xrays and bloodwork at the vet revealed she has a severe infection in her lungs and can barely breathe. She received lots of fluids, injections and is on three different antibiotics, special prescription food and bed rest. Lana urgently needs continued veterinary care to recover. In addition to these medical needs, Lana also requires food and supplies while she recovers in my care.

Lana’s journey has been especially difficult because she was abused and neglected before coming to the shelter. She is extremely shut down and needs time, patience, and support to heal both physically and emotionally. I’m committed to giving Lana the best chance at a healthy life. My goal is to get her the treatment she needs as soon as possible so she can recover and eventually find a loving, permanent home. Every contribution will go directly toward her veterinary bills, medication, and daily care. Your support will help Lana heal and give her the future she deserves.

Help Hannah to Walk Again,"Imagine the fear of being hit by a car, then turned into a shelter, in pain and afraid.  Hannah, a 7-month-old puppy, was surrendered to the Paterson shelter unable to walk on her hind leg and with no pain medication or vet care. Despite having so many special needs medical cases, RBARI heard about Hannah and we knew we had to help.

Hannah is just a puppy and has been through so much already.  She is unable to walk, yet remains super sweet.  Hannah is understandably scared; she cried the whole way to the vet hospital.  It was the type of cry that shatters your heart as you race to the hospital just wanting to give her relief from the fear and pain.  Hannah is amazingly gentle, despite the pain, and she allows handling and snuggles into your arms as you carry her. 

Hannah needs extensive orthopedic surgery immediately.  She is resting at Oradell Animal Hospital on pain medication.  Hannah’s femur is broken so badly that it needs a metal plate.  She has a second break on her hip, also requiring a plate.  Her pelvis is fractured as well. 

Despite her pain, Hannah kisses everyone and yearns for comforting arms to nestle into.  She cannot walk, but her tail never stops wagging.

LET’S FINISH BUILDING OUR NEW ANIMAL SHELTER!,"***Scroll to bottom for an April 2025 update with pictures!***

If you’ve ever visited our shelter, you will know that we have severely outgrown our current location at 36 McCurdy drive - which was constructed in 1993. Our shelter is terribly cramped with cats tucked away in just about every nook and cranny. We do not have a dedicated space for adopters to meet potential family members, no place to meet with community partners or sponsors, and most importantly, no room to take in more animals in desperate need of shelter and care.

Following the Gander and Area SPCA’s inheritance of a sum of $562,00 from the late Ron and Sonya Lyttle of Traytown, NL, we began fundraising the remaining money required to build a brand-new shelter. However, the rising costs of materials trampled our dream of constructing a new building, so we switched gears and instead purchased an existing structure on Magee Road. After facing the challenges of shutdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have slowly but surely chipped away at the renovations required to transform our new building into a state-of-the-art animal shelter.

Even at 8 years old, he has always been an energetic, active dog and his change in behavior was alarming.

We worked with the vet to try to narrow down the cause as more issues kept popping up - after some blood testing they found that his hormone levels were very low and he had begun hormone therapy and a new diet in June.

Two weeks ago, his health deteriorated and after two visits to the vet, blood testing, x-rays and an ultrasound, we were distraught to discover that Tug has Lymphoma in his small intestine that has progressed to where they don't think he has much time left. At this point, the lymphoma is prevalent in his intestine and has caused inflammation in all of his digestive organs surrounding it to where he is unable to process food as normal. Knowing this now, we think he may have been suffering with this for a few years as he has often had random bouts of GI distress and a weakened immune system.",1815.0,2000.0,30.0,https://images.gofundme.com/MwKQl64f_sh-0U54IEu7f9BviAM=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94220951_1756770651206818_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-tugs-comfort-and-care?qid=b7bb97e73049109cac4a80eaef1ddecc,"Dog, Carnivores, Black, Snout, Canidae, Geological formation, Collar, Outcrop, Dog collar, Ancient dog breeds",1

Help Us Give Stray Dogs in Moalboal a Second Chance at Life,"Moalboal Animal Welfare Corp. is a small but dedicated dog shelter based in Moalboal, Cebu, Philippines. Their mission is to be a voice for those who can’t speak for themselves—rescuing, rehabilitating, and caring for the many stray and abandoned animals in the area.

The shelter is run by Ala and Lyndon, a compassionate Filipino couple raising their young family while managing two animal shelters that care for over 90 dogs and cats. Their daily work is an inspiring act of love and service, but they urgently need our help to continue.

Currently, the shelter is struggling with rising veterinary costs, limited funds, and the need for improved facilities. Many of the dogs they rescue arrive malnourished, injured, or suffering from preventable diseases. Your donation will go directly toward vaccinations, spaying/neutering, emergency surgeries, shelter maintenance, and daily food supplies.

Help Us Build A No Kill Animal Shelter,"Odie's Sanctuary Animal Shelter has been created to honor Otis, a truly great shelter dog that passed away in January. We are building an amazing sanctuary for homeless animals and give them the second chance that they deserve.

Have you ever thought about where stray dogs and cats go when they are caught? Have you ever considered the fates of runaways, or abandoned pets, if they are lucky enough for someone with a good heart to find them? The South Coast has thousands of stray dogs and cats roaming the streets, and many of them eventually find their way to shelters.

My dog Otis was one such animal. We found him at a shelter, and took him home. And in our home he was a friend, a confidante, and a part of the family. He passed away in January, and while he is gone his memory is not. The fact that Otis was able to be a part of our lives came down to luck as much as anything else. Nearly all of the shelters in our area have a kill policy; animals who are perfectly adoptable may end up being euthanized because they are old, or not socialized well, or have simply spent too long in an overcrowded shelter.

But we want to ensure that Otis’s name, and the joy he brought to us, lives on. So we are establishing Odie’s Place, a no-kill shelter right here in the New Bedford/Dartmouth area. We will do whatever it takes to make sure that every animal that comes in through our front doors leaves, one day, with its forever family.

And we need your help. We have a fundraising goal of $30,000 to make Odie’s Place a reality. We need to purchase land and construct a shelter, arrange for veterinary care, and connect utilities. We cannot do this without you.

Massachusetts has thousands of animals enter shelters every month, and the majority of those shelters have kill policies. The simple tragic fact is that shelters are overcrowded, and perfectly healthy and well-behaved animals are being killed simply to make room for the incoming onslaught.

Otis made life so much better for us, and we’re on a mission to give that same opportunity to others! Our sanctuary will have a no-kill policy, and we will provide temporary shelter until each stray or abandoned animal is adopted into its forever-family. No one will be killed off to make room!

Rescued for the Role,"Our journey to expanding all started with a rat named Luna. Luna was brought to me by the kind people who found her abandoned and left in a bucket with nothing but fish food to eat. After some time of creating a safe space for her she began showing interest in learning fun tricks for snacks and spending time with me. Luna was then chosen for the role on a very loved children’s show. This little life was tossed aside but when she was shown love and kindness she became a star!

I’m so excited for this next step in being able to provide a safe haven for animals in need. Ontario’s animal shelters are filled to the MAX.

Here are some additional details about their rescue work:
In the decade since the organization was founded, the number of animals they care for daily has grown from a couple dozen to between 70 and 120.
The shelter primarily focuses on rescuing and rehoming dogs and cats in the Liepāja region of Latvia.
They work to give ""a second chance to every paw that walks through our doors"".


They are independant and self funded, and currently in large depth, so need some help with food and bills.

Animal Shelter Appeal.,"We are in crisis.

We are being forced to leave our current shelter.

We need to secure a new premises as soon as possible as time is running out.

Moving forward our long term security will depend on us being able to purchase our own property.
This is why we are desperately appealing to you generosity.
Please dig deep.




WE NEED YOUR HELP

We'll soon be homeless, just like our animals, as time in our current home is nearly up.  This is a crisis for us, can you help? A lot of lives are depending on us as we rescue and re-home several hundred animals every year. Without a suitable premises this will have a dramatic impact on our ability to help as many animals and so we are launching a major fundraising drive to make sure this doesn't happen.
A new premises will be needed in a matter of months and this time we want to buy to ensure the future rescue of many, many animals in need.
Everyone here is a volunteer and we are a non-profit registered charity so every cent raised goes to the animals and none to the humans.  We've been at this work since 1940 so we know what we're doing and want to keep going forever.
We rescue animals from cruelty or abandonment and give them all a fresh start in a loving home.


The Big Plan
We've set our target for the realistic sum needed to either buy or build a fit-for-purpose Animal Shelter.  We know it seems a HUGE amount to ask for but all of us here are determined to give this project 100% effort.  We are also putting out a plea for anyone who might assist us with their unpaid skills eg.  Public Relation, Planners, Builders Carpentry, supplies.


We do all this for the animals and not for ourselves so we thank you in advance on behalf of all those whose lives will either be saved or improved by your generosity.


With heartfelt gratitude,
all at K.W.W.S.P.C.A.

Support Enzo's Urgent Eye Surgery,"I rescued my Enzo from a local animal shelter in Tampa almost three years ago. He had been at the shelter for over a month and was already completely blind. He was found as a stray on the street, covered in fleas, and had no fur. Unfortunately, being held at a not-for-profit shelter, they weren’t able to do much or know much about the state of his sight. I knew adopting him would already be a big responsibility, especially since I was just starting college. But from the moment I saw him, I knew he was the one. He was a happy and overall very healthy pup. I did as much as I could to give him the best life possible while I was attending school.

Recently, I took him to his first veterinary eye specialist to make sure that his eyes were healthy, despite the blindness, and if there was anything I could be doing to enhance his health. Unfortunately, the vet informed me that he had a very severe case of glaucoma (which caused his eyes to become enlarged) and was dealing with chronic pain. The vets told me that he was likely born this way and there wasn’t much I could’ve done early on for him. They told me while there is medication for his condition, in his case, they would prove to be ineffective. The only option would be full removal of his eyes. I was so heartbroken when I heard the news and was devastated to hear he’s been suffering all this time. Luckily the surgery has a very fast recovery time and he will be back to normal within a month.",2880.0,2800.0,80.0,https://images.gofundme.com/zhYbCL306-5BQVMDAk76uWjFDsk=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/92697683_175253222447913_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-enzos-urgent-eye-surgery?qid=44fddf1546ad54ab55343e8b2894382c,"Dog, Vertebrate, Carnivores, Snout, Working animal, Canidae, Pet Supply",1

Unfortunately, the local low-cost clinic couldn’t complete his neuter due to the complexity of his condition. Ronnie now needs a certified surgeon and an ultrasound to locate the elusive testicle and safely remove it.

Dogs of Gyumri(D.O.G)Animal Shelter,"When I first moved to Armenia about a year and a half ago I noticed how badly dogs (and animals in general) were treated. I've always tried doing what I can, but it's always been on a very small scale. But now I'm compelled to go one a slightly larger scale and try and help a larger population of animals in this city. Below, you'll find my inspiration, story, and short term goals (long term goals are still being mapped out). I appreciate any help you can offer ranging from donations, raising awareness, and suggestions/advice. 

It all started with a 2 month old puppy, now named Luna. She was being beat up by some old men on the street and couldn’t walk. People on Facebook fell in love with her! In 2 months she'll be on my way to a far away land called Philadelphia with her newly adopted parents!

She was getting beat up by 3 people on the street when I found her. She then started hysterically crying but couldn’t run off because her legs got hit so hard. I went and brought her home. It speaks to how badly dogs are treated here in Gyumri, and as much as I want to help all of them, i know I can’t. But, I want to take care of her and will take suggestions if you have them. 

My short term goal is to set up a few key ""food terminals"" in my subarb/ city. I have many dogs (and some cats) that I usually feed whatever I have in my fridge, but I would like to make this a more consisten and frequent system. 
A kilo of food costs around $5. I expect that if I fill 2 ""feeding terminals"" a day, that will probably take a kilo per day. 
That makes a total of about $30-35 a week. (This is for 2 terminals. This includes the cost of aluminum containers to put the food in, and gloves to safely work with the dogs). But, this is open to change. The more money we collect, the more terminals I can create on more streets in the area. 

We, the D.O.G. team, are in the planning stages of opening a shelter. Our next short term goal is getting a vehicle. A vehicle is pertinent to our goal as drivers in this city are not happy with putting animals in their cars. The car will be used not only for taking the animals to and from the clinic, but also picking them up and taking them to our soon to be shelter. We are investing in a 2002 Honda CR-V because it's not only a reliable vehicle, but also has a appropriate trunk area to transport animals in.

Mother and son rewire their house and rebuild animal shelter,"Hi! My name's Kimberley and I live with my 15-year-old son on our little hobby farm. We have 2 inside dogs, about 5 outside cats that just showed up and never left, a pot-bellied pig that came to live with us when he was no longer small and cute, 2 old rescued off-the-track racehorses, and a whole lot of chickens. My husband passed away unexpectedly a little over two years ago with no life insurance. It's been a battle every day, but we make it work. I'm hoping to raise money to help make the animals' shelters more secure for the upcoming hurricane season. What we have works but is very old and, even with repairs, won't last much longer. My son and I are able to build and repair but need help with building supplies: wood, tin, nails, things along those lines. We also never turn away an animal that needs us. We are hoping in the future that we will have a setup that will allow us to help more animals that need a place where they will never have to fear going hungry or being discarded again.

About Marshmallow Animal Shelter:
Marshmallow Animal Shelter was established as a 501(c) (3) non-profit animal shelter in 2008 in honor of ‘Cocoa’ and her ‘Eleven Marshmallows’. Cocoa was a Labrador mom that had been abandoned and locked in a house for 3 weeks before being rescued by a Sheriff in Iowa. Being obviously pregnant, Cocoa was taken to a local veterinarian and with the generosity and compassion of many people, she came to rest in Minnesota at the Livingston-Wiedewitsch home and went on to whelp an astonishing eleven (marshmallow) puppies. All puppies were adopted into loving homes but there are many more animals each day that need our help! The ultimate goal is to improve animal welfare and increase public awareness and actively promote spay and neuter programs. The animal shelter provides impound services for seven area cities, providing a public resource for stray, abandoned, and rescued companion animals.",5560.0,750000.0,468.0,https://images.gofundme.com/sy54mguNUHsFZQXlaZGEdspYYHo=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/80913315_1720035132140910_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-marshmallow-animal-shelters-home?qid=1270d883a0d75e895e6b31bc1bc4cb8b,"Logo, Symbol, Label, Sign, Graphics, Graphic design, Canidae",1

Support Jamey Paul's Eagle Scout Project for Aullwood,"My name is James Paul, and I am a Life Scout from Scout BSA Troop 325 in Englewood, Ohio. I am currently planning my Eagle Scout Service Project, and I am seeking 100 donors to contribute just $13.00 to reach my $1,300 goal by August 30th.

My Eagle Project is in support of Aullwood Audubon, a treasured local nature center nonprofit, where I will be building a 10 x 12 x 8 farm animal shelter. This project fulfills an urgent need for Aullwood, as they are legally required to have a shelter on each pasture but lack the necessary resources and labor. The man-made shelter will provide the animals with much-needed refuge from wind, rain, snow, or excessive direct sunlight. I have recruited a team of volunteers, and I intend to conduct this project during the last weekend of September.",1300.0,1300.0,67.0,https://images.gofundme.com/Ny5bN5IR4aSKt-0djqWw0kYrqDg=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93107557_175366280170445_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-jamey-pauls-eagle-scout-project-for-aullwood?qid=44fddf1546ad54ab55343e8b2894382c,"Scout, Uniform, Leisure, Crew",0

MONROE COUNTY ANIMAL SHELTER NEEDS AC,"Hey!
 I’d like to start with, I’m sure you have all seen the posts moving around facebook about Monroe County Animal Shelter-MI not having air conditioning for the back kennel room. So here I am, I’m starting this in honor of all the dogs & cats who have no air. There are 3 industrial fans, pushing air throughout & a ceiling ventilation system which is amazing, but wouldn’t it be so much nicer to have air! We are trying to purchase portable ventless air condition units to put throughout the dog & cat kennel areas. It is a large space so we are going to need a minimum of 6 to cool both dog & cat areas. Each unit is $499.00 if we decide this is best fitted. If not we will have wiggle room to purchase what we need. 
Being the shelter is not a “non profitable” business they cannot personally ask for funding throughout the community. That’s where I come in.
Is air a necessity to survive? No. Is it a luxury to make living more comfortable yes. Wouldn’t it be great if we could all come together to give these animals that kind of comfort on the hot summer days. 
If you feel uncomfortable donating, please contact them (go fund me will not allow me to post a phone number) please go to their facebook page to get it- they are fully aware of this fundraiser. Thank you! As quick as everyone shared the other post, I hope this gets shared 10x more. As always, if you can’t donate, SHARE. SHARE. SHARE.

Please Help Finch to Breathe,"Finch is struggling to breathe.  Please get her the surgery she needs this Thanksgiving to finally find peace and happiness!


Finch’s life hasn’t been an easy one.  Growing up in a massive hoarding home with special needs, it was a miracle that she even survived.  Finch is a fighter though, and she is still with us fighting to survive and fighting to find her forever home. First, however, Finch needs major surgery to help her to breathe.  We are seeking funds to give Finch a new life this Thanksgiving.
 
Finch is two years old and was rescued from a hoarding home last year by RBARI.  The conditions in the home were truly unspeakable.  It is heartbreaking that she had to live that way, and incredible that she survived,  but Finch still lives with daily discomfort in every breath that she takes.

Finch wheezes when she breathes.  She is able to eat, drink, play a little and use the litter box without issue, but it is uncomfortable for her to breathe.  Our hearts broke for Finch to finally be safe and cared for but not able to be at peace.  We sought out immediate medical help.  The cause was undetermined and treatments unsuccessful, so we got a second opinion, and next a specialist.  Finch had a CT scan and rhinoscopy done to finally determine a diagnosis. Testing and diagnostics have cost RBARI thousands, but we are committed to Finch and finally helping her to breathe comfortably.
 
Finch was diagnosed with Nasopharyngeal Stenosis, which means that the area above her soft pallet in not opening wide enough when inhaling, which is affecting Finch's ability to move air back and forth and properly into the lungs. This is affecting Finch’s quality of life and causing her to struggle to breathe.

Finch needs a stent surgery to permanently correct this condition and AMC in New York is the only hospital in our area that effectively can do this surgery.  Ironically, Finch’s consult and surgery can be scheduled for Thanksgiving day. 

RBARI staff is eager to help Finch finally breathe without effort and have offered to drive her into New York City for a consult and surgery on Thanksgiving.  Surgery will be same-day, so we need to raise the funds now to be able to help our sweet girl breathe easy for the holidays. 

Please make a donation towards Finch’s surgery.  No amount is too small to give this little girl peace and comfort.  Please also share her story in hopes of finding Finch a home for the holidays.",5050.0,5000.0,2520.0,https://images.gofundme.com/oCGxro0jKEyH_PwpNrRRlLk_Pyo=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/34330520_1542146484738983_r.jpeg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-help-finch-to-breathe?qid=c8c809e595ee1756937b94b8bd654c62,"Cat, Felidae, Felinae, Vertebrate, Whiskers, Carnivores, Snout, Terrestrial animal, Fur, Close-up",1
Help Ginger Fight FIP,"Our cats Ginger (orange cat) and Mimi (gray cat) were born from the same litter and threatened to be sent to an animal shelter due to a housing situation. We took them both in as an attempt to give them a great life. These cats have grown together for every second of their lives and are now inseparable brothers.

Recently, Ginger was having weird behavior and intense breathing cycles, so we decided to take him to the emergency vet to figure out what was wrong with him. After paying $1,200 out of pocket and waiting 4 hours, we received the news that he was diagnosed with Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP). Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a serious illness in cats caused by a mutated form of a common virus called the feline coronavirus (FCoV). Many cats carry the regular feline coronavirus and don't get sick, but for a select few, like Ginger, it mutates inside the body and turns into the dangerous form that causes FIP. Ginger has ""Dry"" FIP, which causes inflammation in organs like the eyes, brain, or kidneys, leading to symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or neurological signs.",648.0,2000.0,12.0,https://images.gofundme.com/2AJ60Z5w48SKxoBoXwsOAsEDhOE=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94833723_1758390866816795_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/t4ncgs-help-ginger-fight-fip?qid=af3e49b735550fdff740359f62fb040c,"Cat, Felidae, Vertebrate, Felinae, Carnivores, Fur, Snout, Terrestrial animal, Whiskers, Tail",0

Trinity Co Animal Shelter Auxiliary Fund,"Trinity County is a large rural county located in Northern California which is host to a slowly growing population of aproximately 12,000 people. To accomidate all of their pets, it is home to the Trinity County Animal Shelter in the central town of Weaverville. They are a small, county-run shelter which subsists on a small stipend from the county and the wonderful generosity of the surrounding public. Our local animal shelter is managed by only one Animal Control Officer for the entire 3179.25 square mile county and is overseen by 3 part-time employees. The rest of their tiny team consists of some very dedicated volunteers. To assist them with their many funds for the animals, the shelter is fortunate to have a very active volunteer auxiliary notably named the Trinity Animal Shelter Auxiliary (TASA). We are TASA and we do our best to help raise funds, not only for the animal's medical needs when the shelter find lost and injured pets but, for the spay and neuter fund. This fund goes directly to spaying and neutering the shelter animals as well as to the spay and neuter program that assists our community's pet overpopulation. This program has helped hundreds of Trinity County pet owners with the funds to fix their furry family members. Even with the many pets that have already been altered, there unfortunately is still an overwhelming number of homeless pets found every day. Our tiny mountain shelter needs to also raise funds for its day to day operations as well as its other various community programs.

Moe’s Animal Shelter needs your help!,"Moe’s Animal Shelter is home to over 100 dogs and 40 cats, based on the outskirts of Beirut in Lebanon. It is run by Moe Diabe and his two brothers, who work tirelessly to rescue dumped and helpless animals in their city. The shelter has no regular volunteers… everything in the shelter now they have built themselves and worked incredibly hard for.

Over the last 12 months they have made amazing developments including weatherproof metal houses for the dogs, installing solar panels, large water storage tanks and a recently purchased new large freezer (to store more food and cut down expensive daily trips), as well as neutering and spaying as many dogs as possible.

With the number of dogs in their care increasing almost daily, the shelter is now very overcrowded and More space for the dogs to move around freely and not be on top of each other. Unfortunately there have been fights breaking out as the dogs simply don’t have enough space.

Renting land in Lebanon is expensive, and with the cost of living rapidly increasing there, they have already seen their current monthly cost to rent the shelter land double over the last few months.

(such as concrete / cement for adequate sewers / electricity / additional housing kennels / secure fencing / water tanks and shade sails to protect the dogs from the hot sun). The cost of building materials is so high in Lebanon as nearly everything needs to be imported in. 

There is also the very real demand to continue to meet the ongoing costs of food, water, medical supplies and veterinary treatments for injured or unwell dogs. Please continue your wonderful support and help these animals have an improved quality of life in their shelter home. All funds are sent directly to Moe.

Support Brittany's Search for Lost Dog Scooby,"Hello my name is Brittany and I am creating this GoFundMe to raise $1,000 as a reward for my lost dog, Scooby.

I don’t have much to offer, and unfortunately, many people are not willing to give up something that doesn’t belong to them without a reward. I love my dog so much and just want him home where he belongs. Any amount you can donate will go directly toward the reward to help bring Scooby back safely.

Support Calvin's Cupboard: Feed Pets in Need,"Hi all! My name is Lee and I’m launching Calvin’s Cupboard, a mobile pet pantry named after my dog Calvin.

Too many families in Northwest Arkansas face the impossible choice between feeding themselves and feeding their pets. A partial look into local surrender data indicates that nearly 1 in 10 animal surrenders in NWA are due to financial hardship. This comes from a very small set of data and the actual number is likely much larger.

I have first hand experience working in local animal shelters, where I have helped people through the very difficult decision to surrender their pet due to financial circumstances, very often out of their control. Getting help with pet food can often mean the pet can stay with their people, out of the shelter. This allows our local shelters to focus on animals that do not already have a home where they are loved.",1220.0,1000.0,8.0,https://images.gofundme.com/qU7B2yIlZZFOGpFu1kbO7FVedOk=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94822685_1758348342354166_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-calvins-cupboard-feed-pets-in-need?qid=af3e49b735550fdff740359f62fb040c,"Snout, Graphics, Canidae",0

It's been too expensive for me to save up to move out into an apartment.

Friends of Blakely Animal Shelter,"BLAKELY, GA
The shelter volunteers are calling it “a near tragedy.”

Volunteer Amanda reported to feed the animals as she does nearly every Sunday. “Everything was fine in the cat room, but when I walked outside to check on the dogs, I knew something was wrong immediately!”

She sprang into action, quickly checking to make sure all dogs were accounted for and unharmed. Fortunately all are fine. However, none of the nearby dogs seem to know what happened.

“I ain’t did nothing,” said Millie. “Will you rub my belly now? And take me outside to play?”

According to nearby resident Blackie, “Snitches get stitches and I still need to be neutered so I have enough stitches in my future.”

We also talked to Calypso who is kenneled on Millie’s right, along with her puppy Echo. “I’m not sure what happened, but I sure hope the bed explosions are contained. I’m trying to raise a child here and as a single mother, I have a hard enough time of it. We need to move to a better neighborhood but until somebody steps up to help us out, this is all we got.”

Volunteer Debbie McDonald said she was the one who gave the bed to Millie but she had no idea it would explode. “I’m so sorry the dogs were all traumatized like this. I had no idea this bed would explode. I just wanted Millie to be comfortable. I’m just glad she’s ok!”

This is a developing story and we will report updates as they come in.

Help Emmet County Animal Shelter,"During the night of Saturday, February 7th, vandals broke into the fledgling Emmet County Animal Shelter by forcing open the front door.  After getting inside, they damaged screens of the cat enclosures and did hundreds of dollars worth of further damage to the facility.

Thankfully, none of the animals were harmed or escaped, but it brings up the worry that they might if it happens again.

The Emmet County Animal Shelter is new to our community after fighting hard for years to get permission to build a facility. The community has supported it enthusiastically and is devastated that someone could so callously harm something whose sole intent is to help provide a voice and care for beings who do not have a voice of their own.

The animal shelter is a no-kill shelter staffed by volunteers, so every penny is needed to pay for overhead costs.  Paying for these repairs will be incredibly difficult for them to do.

I want to raise enough money to not only help them cover the cost of repairs, but to purchase security cameras and equipment to help deter future vandalism, and have enough extra to offer a reward for information bringing these vandals to justice.

Whether you're a member of the community, thankful for the service the shelter offers, or you live far away but have a love for animals and those who help them, please donate and help them recover from and prevent any further vandalism.

This is the shelter's website, if you're able to offer other kinds of assistance and support. www.emmetcountyanimalshelter.org

Help Save Pax - Starved Puppy,"Animal control responded to complaints today from neighbors of an emaciated puppy with strong odor being kept outdoors in the heat with no food or water. Being an inner city animal control, they often went on calls like this, but no one was prepared for what they found. A skeleton of a puppy wagged his emaciated body as they approached. He then collapsed from the exertion and excitement of greeting a visitor, having been alone for days. The officer took him off his chain and brought him into the home, where he staggered over to the toilet and drank all the water out of it before she could stop him. Infected skin flaked from his body as he continued to wag his tail falling over because he was so dehydrated and starved. He had an extremely strong odor from his skin infection and the feces and urine he was living in. The owners admitted that he hadn’t eaten in days. RBARI rescuers raced to meet animal control and get the puppy immediate medical care. The puppy’s tail never stopped wagging – he was so excited to finally have human contact and kind touch. The rescuers took him into their arms in a big fluffy towel because he was so frail. The towel seemed to weigh more than his tiny body. This happy, dying puppy quickly found his name – Pax – meaning peace because he had finally found his peace after being kept alone with no food or water tied to a porch in extreme heat with painful infected skin and standing in his feces and urine. Rescuers rushed Pax to Oradell Animal Hospital. They almost forgot how sick he was because his frail body was hidden by the comfy towel and he never stopped kissing them. When they arrived and unwrapped him, he began wiggling again. He was so happy, his tail wagging furiously – all the while the rescuers were in tears as he tipped over again and again from weakness, his skin flaked to the floor and his little heartbeat seemed to shine right through his paper-thin skin. That little heart seems to be what got him through so many long days and even longer nights. Pax will be hospitalized and on IV fluids and antibiotics with 24 hour care for the next several days until he is stabilized. Food will need to be slowly reintroduced to his body. He is getting an immediate bath and skin treatment. Pax is finally at peace, and we can’t wait to give him all of the attention, love and care that he has so desperately been craving. Please make a donation towards Pax care to help us to help him and so many others in desperate need.",9045.0,4000.0,3364.0,https://images.gofundme.com/r0mPQsz9RUPmYNlLl2dAKzFsp-w=/1200x900/https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/13017121_1468796297.5408.jpg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/2ez9qu8k?qid=aba8518be6e50e5e90adc75a115b7193,"Dog, Vertebrate, Carnivores, Snout, Working animal, Canidae, Fur, Pet Supply, Paw",1
Support Celeste Banner’s Road to Independence,"Celeste Banner has dedicated nineteen years to serving her community as a Sullivan County Deputy in Bristol, TN. Recently, her life changed dramatically when she lost her leg due to health complications and also lost the function of her kidneys. Despite these challenges, Celeste’s spirit remains unbroken. She is well known for her sense of humor and her deep love for animals, and she continues to bring light to those around her even in the face of adversity. Her dream is to regain her independence and return to the life she loves, including volunteering at the local animal shelter when she is able.

Celeste’s journey ahead is filled with new obstacles. She needs a handicapped accessible apartment, reliable transportation to dialysis and physical therapy, and specialized furniture like a temperpedic bed and an electric recliner to support her mobility. Medical equipment and devices will also be essential for her daily comfort and safety. While Celeste has a small family—her sister and a few relatives—she is surrounded by friends and colleagues who admire her resilience and kindness. Still, her greatest wish is to live independently, just as she did before her health took this turn.

Celeste has always been the first to help others in times of need, whether it’s supporting a friend through illness or loss, or simply sharing a laugh to lift someone’s spirits. Now, she needs her community’s support to create a safe, accessible home and to cover the costs of the medical care and equipment that will help her thrive. Every contribution will help Celeste move forward with hope, dignity, and the independence she deserves.",3245.0,6500.0,28.0,https://images.gofundme.com/ChZbduYvpAjfoXSX534gs9qMftc=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94315307_175700830558663_r.jpeg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-celeste-banners-road-to-independence?qid=42e657e08f9b516d3e9ee47c1b3da4c1,"Dog, Carnivores, Smile, Vertebrate, Canidae, Working animal, Herding dog, Happiness, Border Collie, Australian Shepherd",1
Help Reus Get the MRI & Care He Desperately Needs,"Friends and neighbors, the Thomas family unexpectedly find themselves in a position of needing support in seeking care for their beloved four-legged family member! If you have had the pleasure of meeting Steve Thomas in our community, then you have most likely shared an encounter with his loyal sidekick, Reus. Below is their beautiful backstory.

Reus Thomas is a 10-year-old full-blooded German Shepherd with a heart as big as his paws. His story began in 2018 when Noah Thomas rescued him from the Decatur Animal Shelter. Reus was only two years old, and he and Noah were inseparable. From college dorms to countless soccer fields, hiking trails across North Georgia, and every road trip in between, Reus was Noah’s loyal shadow—his A1 since day one road dog! When Noah’s busy college and soccer schedule made it too hard to keep Reus hidden in dorm life, Reus came to live with his granddad, Steve, who quickly stepped in to keep his adventurous life just as full—taking him to practices, games, and everywhere in between.",955.0,2200.0,14.0,https://images.gofundme.com/KPcG38stAPcweHurE-fSZ57YZNE=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94779481_1758229103266751_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-reus-and-steve-thomas?qid=af3e49b735550fdff740359f62fb040c,"Dog, Smile, Summer, Carnivores, Happiness, German Shepherd, Barechestedness, Facial hair, Vacation, Beard",0
Support Wilson's Fight Against Parvo Virus,"Many people do not know this but on Monday, August 18th Nick and I picked up the newest edition to our family, Wilson! normally this is an exciting time with puppy fever, watching him grow and find his place in our home with Ralph & Oakley. We were so looking forward to seeing them interact and seeing Wilson just being a happy, crazy puppy. Unfortunately, just a few hours after picking him up from the previous “owner” After a few hours, Wilson began exhibiting the classic signs of Parvo virus. We rushed him to the vet and found out Tuesday morning at 9:30 that Wilson was Parvo Positive. For those that don’t know, Parvo is an extremely life threatening virus. It can be transferred from mother to puppy, feces, or being around other dogs that have it. The previous owner made no mention of him being sick, but given that the symptoms were almost immediately present upon picking him up, we do believe the owner knew and chose to not disclose. He was admitted to Blue Pearl Animal hospital to try and save his life. this is been a roller coaster of ups and downs, not knowing what is next, and if he will make it through. This journey has been filled with long nights of thinking about the unknowns, tears, frustration, anger and sadness. Wondering why someone wouldn’t just get the puppy vaccinated at the right time. All we can do is handle the cards we have been dealt and get Wilson the best care we possibly can and this is where we need help. The vet bills have wracked up a lot but we don’t want to stop the care to give him the best shot at life. Anything helps! In the event that donations exceed his current bill (which is at about $9,600) additional funds will be donated to our local animal shelter.

Let's Start a West Coast Animal Shelter!,"Animals are suffering along the coast and together we can help them.

Our coastal communities need a capable of housing injured, neglected, sick and homeless dogs, cats, birds and other animals. Since 2011, CARE Network has been finding critical overnight care and shelter for hundreds of these animals each year in volunteer foster homes but the demand is now too high.

100% of your donation will be used to create a central animal care centre made out of shipping containers (see mock up) that includes safe spaces for cats, dogs and other animals, and an office/examination room for visiting veterinarians to treat animals. We have researched and found the most suitable equipment for our needs out here. Our initial setup will even include some isolated and easy to sterilize kennels so we are ready for the next parvo virus outbreak.


With your generous support now, CARE will be able to have this innovative facility operational and saving animal lives before July (2019). $45,000 will go towards constructing the container building and $20,000 will be used to purchase the kennels and other critical equipment needed. Once all the funds are raised we will immediately purchase the equipment and start getting setup.

By investing in this community resource together, we can make our communities safer and heathier for all residents, whether they have two legs, four or feathers.




CARE Network, based in Tofino, works on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, where there are small, hard to access communities spread over a number of islands. This region faces many dire animal issues, including massive animal overpopulation, sick and injured animals, puppies and kittens being born with no one to care for them, unvaccinated puppies succumbing to the Parvo virus, free-roaming and packing dogs that bite and scare community members, dogs that kill and injure other animals, as well as animals dying from starvation and wolf and cougar predation. 

Thank you to the District of Tofino for providing the funds CARE used to host the information sessions that have led to this exciting project that will benefit Tofino residents, visitors, neighbouring communities and of course the wild and domesticated animals it will serve.

Support Dooey-Doo's Life-Saving Surgery,"About Doo!
Our fantastically mustached little man, ""Dooey-Doo"" was rescued from our local animal shelter 11 years ago. Part of a Star Wars themed litter, his shelter nickname was Darth Mittens. We knew immediately he was ours when he climbed right into our laps and purred away, and we took him home that day. Even as an kitten, he brought comfort to everyone and everything: a few days after bringing him home, we learned that he had bonded with an abused, very timid black kitten named Sam, who had withdrawn once Doo left with us... So of course, we went back for him, too!

Now, 11 years old, he is still just as sweet of a cat who thinks he might be part dog and part human. Possibly also part macaroni, given his love for sleeping in tupperware bins. He comes trotting in when you call him, leads us to the fridge at meal times, relaxes and hands you his paws for his mani-pedis, and snuggles his human-mom every night... Curled against her side, with his head and arm on her chest, like a person. His favorite past time is rocking with her in the rocking chair, one paw on each shoulder.

Save Periwinkle: Urgent Medical Help Needed,"Hello friends and family!! Thank you for your generosity. Here's what's happened: Periwinkle is my indoor only, tuxedo cat around 2 and half years old. I love her dearly. I adopted her from the Oakland Animal Shelter. This past weekend she has been very lethargic, and had a low appetite. On 8/11/2025 Periwinkle had no interest in eating at all, so I took her into the OakVet Animal Specialty Hospital as an emergency, and additionally set up an appointment at the soonest available time with Periwinkle's regular doctor at The Cheshire Cat Clinic. The initial check up showed she had a 103.8 high fever, was dehydrated, loss of fat and muscle, and was breathing hard and fast. The visiting Vet (DVM) suggested a General blood test, Chest x-ray, and Ultrasound of abdomen cavity. The blood test revealed a high white blood cell count indicative of infection and the x-ray revealed both of Periwinkle's lungs seemed to be consolidated. The DVM attempted to collect and sample any fluid outside of the lung but was not able to collect any fluid, because very little fluid was present at the time, leading for the DVM to believe Periwinkle was suffering from pneumonia. I was allowed to take Periwinkle home with instructions to administer antibiotics and monitor for signs of improvement (normal breathing rate). Periwinkle was still not interested in eating and very resistant to any syringe feeding. With much effort I was able to syringe her some meat flavored baby food and syringe the antibiotics, though this was very difficult. At home, Periwinkle was very clearly breathing hard, and struggling to be comfortable, though her breathing rate stayed the same and she was mobile and still very spunky. On 08/12/2025, at midnight I decided bring Periwinkle back into the OakVet Hospital to be hospitalized.",668.0,4500.0,51.0,https://images.gofundme.com/p-aFfvycYThgTaPY9j2FVnJukiY=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93602035_1755054360587561_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-periwinkle-urgent-medical-help-needed?qid=af3e49b735550fdff740359f62fb040c,"Cat, Felidae, Felinae, Carnivores, Whiskers, Snout, Pet Supply, Fur, Domestic short-haired cat, Mesh",0

HELP Naples Animal Shelters IRMA,"Hurricane Irma hit Naples, FL on Sept 10 and did extensive damage. The animals in shelters and rescue groups have had a terrible time - no power for AC, the water must be boiled due to sewage back-up, and the volunteers are exhausted. Many animals are being transported to other shelters around the nation because adoption rates will fall dramatically in the next few months in Naples. Residents in Naples are trying to survive and not thinking about adding a new pet into their home. Also, homeowners who have had damage, flooding, or are out of work may relinquish their family pet to the shelters because they can not take care of them anymore.

Please consider donating to this fund, which are distributed and managed by Ericka Basile, long-time Naples resident.  Ms. Basile will withdraw the funds (and pay any fees/taxes) and then distribute the remaining funds (after gofundme fees and/or credit card transaction fees) evenly to the Directors for these animal organizations: Domestic Animal Services Trust Fund,  Humane Society of Naples, Gulf Coast Humane Society, For The Love of Cats and Golden Retriever Rescue of Southwest Florida.

Ericka Basile works for Tall Tails, a pet product manufacturer. She was also the former product scout for Dr. Marty Becker, America's Vet for Good Morning America and Dr. Oz.  Ms. Basile wants to stress that if you can not give funds, please consider donating pet products. These pet products can be mailed to:
803 Vanderbilt Beach Road, Naples FL 34108.

Help us heal Deiter,"Deiter was rescued just hours from euthanasia alongside his sister, Anastasia from the Carson Animal Shelter. We’re so grateful that he’s here with us today, but Deiter has mental scars from his past that he cannot shake. He has intense fear with strangers and he responds with fear aggression. Unfortunately, he’s bitten several people, though he hasn’t caused any significant harm to any person. Rescue isn’t just about healing broken bones and illnesses, sometimes it’s about healing the mental scars that come from trauma that humans caused. Deiter didn’t ask to be here and he didn’t ask to endure the trauma he’s had to face. He deserves a path to a life without fear and without anxiety and without him feeling the need to protect himself from everybody. Deiter has several trainers who work with him often. They all agree that Deiter is not a lost cause. He’s not inherently aggressive, he’s just under-socialized, insecure and anxious. The good news is that this is fixable! But the bad news is, this month long board and train program costs $3,500. This program will be essential for Deiter to become adoptable and have the future he deserves.

Be Their Hero: Save Karla's Animal Shelter!,"SAVE KARLA’S ANIMAL SHELTER

Karla is a noble woman who has dedicated her entire life to the care of vulnerable animals in Nicaragua. Shellthon Zamora, the animal sanctuary she has spent the past 12 years building, is now in danger of thievery and starvation.

Karla and Her Family

Karla’s work began at a young age, saving dogs and running operations out of her family home. Soon, however, this space was too small to accommodate all of the animals, and she expanded to a small plot of land with the help of a charity. With these new resources, she exponentially grew the number and types of animals she rescued– now hosting dozens of horses, dogs, cats, pigs, chickens, and many more. Even to an onlooker, it’s clear how deeply she cares for each and every one of these animals, and how much they love her in turn. The way the cats hover at her feet, or the way the pigs lean happily into her touch tell a story of a woman who not only cares for these animals as creatures, but as family.",1118.0,2000.0,379.0,https://images.gofundme.com/L94J4M3M_xH05nSvsM04WTIoiCQ=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/82864791_1726699954819763_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/urgent-aid-needed-for-karlas-animal-refuge?qid=54a80c3c35ee527d2dd231684a3b567b,"Dog, Working animal, Carnivores, Horse, Pack animal, Canidae, Animal shelter, Street dog, Mare, Stable",0

Give Jelly a chance at a healthy happy life!,"Hi, my name is Shiloh Colon. I recently adopted a sweet senior cat named Jelly from a local animal shelter. She’s 11 years old, born on October 12, 2013, and weighs just under 10 pounds. I brought Jelly home with the hopes of giving her a loving, peaceful life — helping her manage her weight and enjoy her golden years in comfort and care.

Unfortunately, things took a difficult turn almost immediately after adoption.

There is an influx of homeless dogs flooding into animal shelters, and this problem is becoming more severe each and every day due to factors such as the increase in people purchasing from breeders rather than adopting. Thousands of breeders are cruel and unethical, operating in puppy mills where they overbreed dogs, causing them severe pain, suffering, and long-term health issues. This is done solely for the breeder's profit without regard for the dog's health or well-being. Several animal shelters nationwide are currently overwhelmed and unable to take in more animals.

We brought him to the emergency vet and they couldn’t give us any diagnosis or medicine despite the $1000 spent. We than took him back once again, another $500 for no diagnosis and some antibiotics. As he worsened we took him to the vet for another $450 mostly for testing. With another $500 vet visit, Leo was diagnosed with FIP. FIP being a rare condition where fluid builds up in the chest cavity or stomach making it hard to breath, it being fatal and extremely uncomfortable and painful. Leo doesn’t have much time left, he is becoming very skinny with little eating and his breathing has worsened. To do the entire 84 day treatment, which has a chance of not even working, or Leo relapsing again later on, is over $10,000. To afford to save Leo we need all the help we can get. Anything would be greatly appreciated to raise money in saving and caring for Leo. He is the best kitten anyone could ask for, we would be heartbroken to lose him.",160.0,3500.0,15.0,https://images.gofundme.com/GEviek3qF8dXx1K00aNgknN6j4A=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94684345_1757985782537398_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/mkccs-support-leos-fight-against-fip?qid=05451dc5b43081aeb17b15534d4b4c3f,"Cat, Felidae, Felinae, Whiskers, Carnivores, Snout, Terrestrial animal, Fur, Close-up, Grey",0

New Lake County Animal Shelter,"We desparately need to build a new animal shelter in Lake County, FL.

Four months ago we began implementing  a ""no kill"" program at the Lake County animal shelter. Our shelter serves thirteen cities and all of the unincorporated areas. We have achieved our first milestone: a greater than 90% live release rate. This can only be sustained through adoption events, fostering, spay & nuetering, and the hard work of amazing rescue groups and volunteers.

We continue to seek out the most effective ways to reach our ""no kill"" goals and promote and improve animal welfare throughout our community. It isn't easy, and progress always includes setbacks. The key is to stay focused on the ultimate goal.

Our current shelter is in poor condition and is much too costly to renovate.

With strong community support we can expedite the construction process by raising funds to design and begin construction of this project -- with a goal of completion by this time next year. 

Any amount will help expedite the construction process.  



Donations are tax deductible and will be deposited with  the Mount Dora Community Trust, a 501(c)(3) non profit corporation. The organizer of this effort is Leslie Campione, a local attorney and Lake County Commissioner.

I want to change that by supporting as many animal shelters as possible—especially those that are local or facing urgent needs.

With your help, I’ll personally deliver food, medical supplies, blankets, beds, crates, and toys to different shelters each month. By working directly with these organizations, I can make sure your donations reach the animals who need them most. Every contribution will help provide comfort, care, and a better chance at a happy life for abandoned and vulnerable animals.

This fundraiser is just the beginning. My ultimate goal is to one day create a sanctuary for abandoned animals—a safe haven where they can heal and find loving homes. Until then, I’m committed to making a difference, one shelter at a time. Thank you for joining me on this journey to give every animal the care and love they deserve.",,,26.0,https://images.gofundme.com/QtZXvy7ogYEzeQ3adNja3DJhEaM=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94385253_1757196821869750_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-animal-shelters-build-a-sanctuary?qid=89f3e1bb4bfa911b551bc32aee2292c7,"Font, Snout, Graphics, Graphic design, Animation, Clip art",0

Support Cindy's Mission for Animal Shelters,"Hello, I'm Cindy, a student trying to make a nonprofit for all the hardworking shelters that are in need of money or help to pay people to foster or adopt animals.

I've been volunteering and fostering animals near my local shelter, and people have been coming in trying to give them lost or hurt animals roaming around the street, but they had to be declined since this shelter was incredibly small and had over 400 cats along with 20 dogs and was running low on food and cages. It breaks my heart knowing other shelters around the world are also suffering. For example, in LA, animals have been dying left and right with horrible shelter conditions with no beds and GREEN water due to the owner exploiting them. Now, I'm not too aware of this situation, but I also don't want the money to be in the wrong hands.",,,138.0,https://images.gofundme.com/vfCQ2t7ucFWnHIZ7cYGIc76wG1U=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/91156101_1747586886395423_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-cindys-mission-for-animal-shelters?qid=c2e790a0025e3c756508668b81bf49a7,"Cat, Felinae, Felidae, Paw, Whiskers, Graphics, Clip art",0
HELP Moldova shelter in SAVING their land!,"PLEASE SHARE!
I am trying to help raising funds for a small animal shelter, located in my birth country Moldova.
While they always need food, assistance with bills and vet expenses, this time it's the matter of their whole existence, since the lot of land they've been renting, is now up for sale, and 300 animals now have nowhere to go.
Unfortunately local laws dont protect animals and dont support people that dedicated their lives to saving animals. Its impossible to run a shelter purely on good intentions, the actual help is needed to at least own the land this shelter stands on. 
Check fundraiser updates for more details.

Thank you in advance for any help, whether monetary contribution or SHARE of this cause. Every little bit helps!

Running for Ruger: Donate to Help Pets in Need,"Running for Ruger.

My name is Kristin Degnan and I’m running my first marathon in honor of my soul dog, Ruger, who crossed the rainbow bridge July 3, 2025. Ruger was an Australian Shepherd. I got him when I was 21 and we literally grew up together. He was, by far, the best dog I could have asked for. Ruger was smart, gentle, funny, loyal, patient, and sweet. He was my shadow, my best friend, and my adventure buddy for 11.5 wonderful years.

Ruger collapsed after a play session on July 1, 2025 and I rushed him to an emergency vet in Lynchburg, VA where they quickly pinpointed the issue. He had a significant amount of fluid around his heart that was preventing his heart from expanding normally. We went straight to Virginia Tech for an emergency cardiology consult. There, a dedicated team diagnosed the cause as a large mass on his right atrium, which was identified as angiosarcoma. In a matter of hours I went from living with my happy and healthy senior dog (who had just had recent blood work done and passed with flying colors), to my best friend having only days or weeks left to live as his body fought against this aggressive cancer. I chose to have the cardiology team remove the fluid from around his heart to make sure he was comfortable, so I could have a little bit of time to take him home, spoil him, and say goodbye to my best friend. He peacefully crossed the rainbow bridge 2 days later and I am now preparing to run the VA Beach Shamrock marathon in March of 2026 to honor Ruger and all the miles we walked/ran/traveled together.",2043.0,10500.0,70.0,https://images.gofundme.com/emGQweqUsuEmQVF720jkQUb9-10=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93007759_1753368208436471_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/running-for-ruger-donate-to-help-pets-in-need?qid=b7bb97e73049109cac4a80eaef1ddecc,"Dog, Carnivores, Snout, Herding dog, Fur, Canidae, Working animal, Border Collie, Australian Collie, Australian Shepherd",1

Donate to Buddy's New Beginning with Family,"I’m raising funds to help my mother in law and brother in law out as they are going to take Buddy in. They are have a dog trainer that’s going to train him, they are going to get him neutered, flea treatment, and all his shots. They are a blessing for taking Buddy in when countless people has tried to help Buddy find a home out side of city limits so he didn’t have to be behavioral euthanized due to an incident that happened in May. Buddy was beat ongoing but when my husband and I found out it was stopped and the one that did it was never at our home again. In May my brother backed out of the driveway and my husband when any of our dogs is on a screened in back porch knows that the neighbors are out we put them back in the house. Well the neighbors youngest daughter came out of their back door as my brother was backing out we have a shared driveway she was skating on and Buddy busted through the screen and bit her. She did have to get stitches on her leg and we got Buddy back in the house. My husband called the police and reported it himself. The next day the animal control came we had to home quarantine as the dog pound was full for rabies precautions and he was current on his rabies vaccinations. When we went to court due to Buddy being a liability and a risk the city of Baxter told us we would have to rehome him. Even though we agreed after asking if we got him trained for 30 days if he could back the answer was no. Hailey, myself, and many others reached out to individuals, and animal sanctuaries, and animal shelters to find him a home. It was either they didn’t want to take the risk or they was full. Buddy needed a home with no other animals or kids. My mother in law and brother in law stepped up since he is moving from DC to live with my mother in law out of the state of Kansas.

It's a lifeline for over 20 dogs, cats, donkeys, and goats, but with the current economic hardship and inflation in Zimbabwe, this amazing organization is struggling to keep up. These animals are vulnerable and desperately need our help. They don't just need food; they need essentials like clean blankets, medications, new bowls, and toys. If you are looking for a way to celebrate with me, please consider a donation, whatever you can spare, to help keep these innocent animals safe, warm, and fed.
Please also share this post to spread the word!

Fundraiser for the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter,"Meet “Chase” Davis, the beloved Pit Bull mix adopted 12 years ago from the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter by Patrick and Jill Davis of Grand Island, NY.  Chase lost his battle with brain cancer during the week of Thanksgiving 2020. 

The employees of Utilant, an enterprise software company based in Buffalo, NY have helped to drive this GoFundMe effort to donate to the Friends of the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter in memory of Chase, their beloved office pet. Chase came into the Utilant office almost daily for the past 11 years, contributing to Utilant’s company culture with his welcoming personality and fun loving spirit. 

As you can see, the


At a time when shelters, rescues, and breeders nationally have reported increased demands due to American’s seeking the comfort of a pet during the pandemic, the Davis’ have taken the opportunity to allow those impacted by the loss of Chase to remember him in a meaningful way.  

Mayor Byron W. Brown stated, “The COVID-19 global health pandemic has touched everyone in some way, including our pets, who for many, are a constant source of comfort. I thank Utilant CEO Patrick Davis and his wife, Jill, as well as Utilant employees, for honoring the memory of their beloved “Chase” by raising over $15,000 to date for the Friends of the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter.”

Raising support for the Friends of the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter will enable the financial support of the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter and its services to the Buffalo community and neighboring areas. The city animal shelter has fewer resources than the SPCA and can use your help this holiday season!  

“The Friends of the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter is an all-volunteer organization whose primary mission is to raise funds and provide financial support for the Shelter through critical and preventative veterinary care, training for Shelter dogs in need, and management of the volunteer and foster care programs,” said Jill Re, Board member.



Friends of the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter exists to promote the health and welfare of animals cared for by the City of Buffalo. Priorities include promoting and funding critical & preventive vet care, adopting dogs and cats, foster care, hospice & palliative care, and community education services. Website:  
 

 
This is the general medical fund that pays for all the needs of the animals above and beyond basic medical care. Sometimes there are several traumas coming through the door in just one day, and the shelter needs additional funding to pay for it. We're proud to say we've never had to say no to funding one of these emergencies.  
 
This program benefits animals that have lifelong medical needs or are seniors but still deserve to be adopted. Reduced or waived adoption fees are provided and often pay for a short period of the animal's needs after adoption to get their family started.   
 
Every animal deserves a chance to be adopted, and some pets need more work than others. If a dog needs additional work, they work with reputable local trainers to give that animal everything it needs to succeed, including a formed committee of dedicated volunteers. This ensures that these select volunteers train the same way and continue the work each day.  
 
This is a fund dedicated to purchasing a new adoption wagon for taking dogs and cats to adoption events all around WNY.  
More about the Davis’: 
 
He was a very good boy that spent many of his days at the office sleeping and getting biscuits from co-workers. On his days off, he enjoyed boating, sleeping, and eating. He will be missed by everyone that knew him.  
 
: Jill and Patrick Davis reside in Grand Island, NY. Patrick is the CEO of a local technology company named Utilant LLC with a headquarters in Buffalo, NY. We care for our companion animals and implore everyone to adopt instead of purchasing your next dog or cat. Many animals in shelters need homes, and for each one that gets adopted, that's one more spot open for an animal stuck on the street to have a chance. 
 


We have a new sponsor, my company, Utilant LLC, who will be helping with the campaign, and our employees have so far donated a large portion of our total so far. As the CEO and founder, my wife and I will continue to match donations up to $20,000 in total donations at 100% matching. We have updated the goal to $20,000 and will re-share the campaign on Friday 12/18 to try and hit our goal by 12/24! 

WOW! We reached our goal of $13,000 in less than 24 hours! Thank you everyone for your generous donations. From $14,000K - $20,000 we will extend our matching but at 100%, donate $100 and we will match $100 for a total of $200. 
 
To accomplish this, Chase and his family will match your donation by 300%. For example, if you donate $100, our family will match you an additional $300 for a total donation of $400, if you donate $50 our family will match you $150 for a total donation of $200. This allows your donation to have 4x the impact this holiday season! This matching will occur until we hit the combined goal of $13,000 in donations. The city animal shelter has fewer resources than the SPCA and can use your help this holiday season!  ",20545.0,20000.0,1758.0,https://images.gofundme.com/zS6MHWVHzl6iLYzBO3tReCfhI7Y=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53158644_1608065140610898_r.jpeg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/chase-davis-fundraiser-for-the-city-animal-shelter?qid=aba8518be6e50e5e90adc75a115b7193,"Dog, Logo, Canidae, Working animal, Advertising, Pet Supply, Graphic design, Kennel club",1

She’s been by my side as I raised my son Miles, always offering patience, love, and happiness.

Hilf unserem kleinen Spock wieder frei atmen zu können,"Hallo, mein Name ist Wanjuscha. Gemeinsam mit meinem Mann, meinen zwei Kindern und unseren beiden Katzen Spock und Fofoinha möchte ich euch unsere Geschichte erzählen.
Im Oktober 2024 haben wir Fofoinha in Portugal von der Straße gerettet, nachdem ihre Mutter sie zurückgelassen hatte. Damit sie nicht alleine ist, haben wir im April 2025 Spock aus dem Tierheim zu uns geholt. Von der ersten Minute an waren die beiden unzertrennlich.
Doch kurze Zeit später begannen die Sorgen: Spock bekam große Probleme beim Atmen. Er kann nicht richtig mauzen, kaum schnurren und schläft fast nur noch auf dem Rücken, weil er sonst keine Luft bekommt. Selbst so schnarcht er ständig, verschluckt sich oder hat kleine Atemaussetzer. Es bricht uns jedes Mal das Herz, ihn so zu sehen.
Unsere Tierärztin überwies uns an die HNO-Abteilung der Kleintierklinik Leipzig. Nur unter Narkose kann festgestellt werden, was ihm genau fehlt – und wahrscheinlich wird direkt eine Operation notwendig sein. Die Kosten dafür belaufen sich auf 3.000 bis 4.000 €.

Animal shelter for winter months,"Hi, my name is Lucy!
I own two beautiful farmyard friends called Jack and Sebastian.
Jack is a large donkey and Sebastian is a Shetland pony. They're the best of friends!
My family built a shed to keep them cozy and safe during the winter months. Unfortunately, due to extreme Irish storms, the shed has completely rotted and crumbled. Last night, it collapsed.
We're struggling to pay for a new shed. I'm hoping to convert a shipping container so it will withstand future winter storms.
Could you spare a donation to help us achieve this? My furry friends need a safe and secure place to sleep at night.

Help Save Our Animals!,"Please join us in saving the animals of Alger County by making a contribution toward our new building. After countless months of fighting our County to allow us to continue rescuing animals in our current facility while maintaining our no-kill status, we are heartbroken to share that our days in our current facility are numbered. After generously having received a piece of land to build our new facility on, we are beginning construction! Our next step: raise enough funds to see the process through. We are anticipating at least $80k in costs for this project. For those able to donate $500 or more, we will permanently acknowledge the generosity by hanging a plaque of sponsorship in the new building. There is no such thing as a donation too small.
About us - we are are located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and we have a strict no-kill policy. All of the animals that enter our shelter are treated with veterinary care and then placed into loving homes. We serve the animals within our county but we also aid in helping shelters outside of our county, kennel availability permitting, in order to relieve the stress of the local shelters who are at maximum capacity, as most are these days. Currently, we are housing numerous dogs and cats, and in 2023, we saw over 150 animals enter into our shelter, all while achieving a 100% no-kill status.",3500.0,80000.0,771.0,https://images.gofundme.com/rRFssL5f8LyenbZuhjMGc7gpeCM=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/74936225_1692841788778021_r.jpeg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/7vcpa-help-us-save-our-shelter?qid=54a80c3c35ee527d2dd231684a3b567b,"Advertising, Poster, Pet Supply, Photo caption",1

Collin's Animal Shelter Project,"Dear Family/ Friend,

As you may know, I have been in Scouting since the first grade.  I started as a Tiger in Cub Scouts and after ten years in scouting, I am now working on my Eagle Rank with Troop 61 in Houston, Texas.  One of my final requirements to earn Eagle rank is to do an Eagle Scout project.  An Eagle Scout project requires me to plan out a project, recruit volunteers, acquire the materials, and act as the leader of the project. 

My project will benefit the Special Pals Animal shelter in West Houston, Texas.  Special Pals has been in operation since 1979 and provides medical care for all of the shelter animals and is able to continue operating as a no-kill shelter, mostly because of the support of the community.  My project is to build 18 custom windows for the dog shelter facility.  The windows are 3’ x 8’ in size. The openings need to be enclosed with windows to prevent the cool air from the newly installed AC system escaping out of the openings.  My project with benefit the sheltered dogs by providing a cool, safe environment, as well as the shelter by helping lower the monthly electricity bill.

I started my project planning in April 2015 and hope to have it completed by the end of June 2015.  My project will require that we build custom-size frames to hold two glass windows.  By using windows, the shelter will be able to continue to have sunlight enter the shelter.  The windows can be opened in the winter to allow for cool air to enter and have the air condition system turned off, saving on electricity.  Once the frames are complete, I will have to paint them and install the system in the existing openings.  The new windows should last a life time, with minimum maintenance.

In order to make my project a reality, I am asking for the financial support of family and friends.  I have estimated that the cost of my project will be about $2,500.  If you are willing and able to donate to my project, I would be greatly appreciative.  Any amount, even $10, would help me complete my project and ultimately earn my Eagle Rank in Scouting and help the Special Pals no-kill shelter.

You can also donate by check.  Please make the check out to Troop 61 and mail to Mike Viator, 12219 Summerland Ridge Lane, Houston, Texas 77041.

Support Bella's Battle with Cancer,"Many of Bella's followers have reached out asking if they could send me some money to help out and show their support. I was hesitant on creating one of these, just because I didn't want to seem like I was desperate or begging for money. But, so many of you said to make one, that I decided it wouldn't hurt.

All funds raised will go towards Bella's vet bills, medication costs, food, and eventually (and unfortunately) end of life costs. If any funds happen to remain left over, I will donate them to a local animal shelter.

As many of Bella's followers know, she was diagnosed with cancer in May. She was also diagnosed with thyroid disease in March. She has had a lot of vet visits and testing done. She's on multiple medications. She also requires more specialized types of food now as well. Vet bills alone have totaled $1,750 since March. That doesn't include all of her medication or foods, etc. The vet requires time of service payments, so there's no outstanding balance. I've been making it work, but my credit card has seen better days. As everyone knows, this economy sucks. Which is why I don't expect anyone to feel like they have to donate anything.

Help Carl & Thorne Recover After House Fire,"On July 27th, Carl and Thorne, along with four other retired racing greyhounds, were caught in a devastating house fire that left them with serious smoke inhalation damage. Tragically, the four other greyhounds lost their lives in the fire. Pam Callahan, their owner, lost everything, including her beloved dogs, but is now focused on helping Carl and Thorne recover.

It is a miracle that Carl and Thorne survived. They are currently being treated at an emergency vet, where they were rushed early Sunday morning. Both dogs require constant oxygen and supportive care as they recover from the effects of severe smoke inhalation. Marion Animal Shelter is helping to cover the cost of their care, but we need the help of our community in order to get these sweet dogs back to full health.

Funds raised will help the Marion Animal Shelter continue to provide Carl and Thorne with ongoing emergency treatment, oxygen therapy, medications, and any additional procedures needed for their recovery. The shelter staff and veterinarians are working tirelessly to give them the best chance at a full recovery, but they can’t do it alone.

Surgery for Lily: Jazmyn’s Loyal Friend,"My name is Jazmyn Singh and I am 19 years old from New Braunfels, TX! My dog's name is Lily; she is a 10-year-old German Shepherd Mix! My family and I adopted her from an animal shelter in San Antonio about 9 years ago. Lily is the sweetest, most loyal companion. She loves going on walks, napping, and will eat anything and everything!

About 3 years ago, we noticed masses on her abdomen and sides. Over time, these masses began to grow and more began to appear. A couple of months ago, a small mass near her left armpit became ulcerated and has remained since. Because her open mass refuses to heal, Lily has been living with a plastic E-collar on so that she is not able to lick her wound, which prevents it from healing. Since Lily has had the E-collar on, her open mass still refuses to heal. After a trip to the veterinarian, we were told that she would need surgery to remove these masses of concern.",540.0,540.0,52.0,https://images.gofundme.com/crMspCh3pTADD809m0uUpk9wCP0=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93541235_1754922293185366_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/surgery-for-lily-jazmyns-loyal-friend?qid=3e05da99384bba523046eac5ff850c53,"Dog, Carnivores, Snout, Pet Supply, Dog collar, Collar, Car seat, Working animal, Dog Supply, Leash",0

Plus we just took in three elderly dogs because their human passed away .  It's heartbreaking watching them not understand where he is and why they are here . These two the Bassett hound and the shepherd Bassett x are both 14 years old.   I feel horrible for them watching them not understand the changes.  
But this is what we do.  We help the whole system.  The pets, their humans and their communities.   
We are an asset to these small communities.  
We have one goat that is in need of a prosthetic leg if anyone knows who or a rescue to take him.
And a baby goat suffering from pneumonia.  It's on it's 4th attempt at different prescriptions and back to the vet Thursday for even more.

Support Enzo's Urgent Eye Surgery,"I rescued my Enzo from a local animal shelter in Tampa almost three years ago. He had been at the shelter for over a month and was already completely blind. He was found as a stray on the street, covered in fleas, and had no fur. Unfortunately, being held at a not-for-profit shelter, they weren’t able to do much or know much about the state of his sight. I knew adopting him would already be a big responsibility, especially since I was just starting college. But from the moment I saw him, I knew he was the one. He was a happy and overall very healthy pup. I did as much as I could to give him the best life possible while I was attending school.

Recently, I took him to his first veterinary eye specialist to make sure that his eyes were healthy, despite the blindness, and if there was anything I could be doing to enhance his health. Unfortunately, the vet informed me that he had a very severe case of glaucoma (which caused his eyes to become enlarged) and was dealing with chronic pain. The vets told me that he was likely born this way and there wasn’t much I could’ve done early on for him. They told me while there is medication for his condition, in his case, they would prove to be ineffective. The only option would be full removal of his eyes. I was so heartbroken when I heard the news and was devastated to hear he’s been suffering all this time. Luckily the surgery has a very fast recovery time and he will be back to normal within a month.",2880.0,2800.0,80.0,https://images.gofundme.com/zhYbCL306-5BQVMDAk76uWjFDsk=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/92697683_175253222447913_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-enzos-urgent-eye-surgery?qid=af3e49b735550fdff740359f62fb040c,"Dog, Vertebrate, Carnivores, Snout, Working animal, Canidae, Pet Supply",1

Banjo's Second Chance,"On the morning of July 1st, I stumbled upon an Instagram reel featuring Banjo--a doe-eyed, rambunctious doberman kenneled in the crowded Devore animal shelter. The caption explained that Banjo was in urgent need of rescue, as he was scheduled to be euthanized that afternoon at 2pm. Across Los Angeles and surrounding regions, the situation is dire: most shelters are exceeding capacity over 200%. This means that dogs surrendered by owners, the product of greedy backyard breeders, or the result of inadequate resources for spaying and neutering never get the opportunity to live full lives.

The comment section on Banjo's post was filled with pledges to contribute to his care, but as is understandable in these situations, there was difficulty in getting him out in time. As those who know me might be aware, I recently lost my soulmate rescue doberman, Charlie, to metastatic lung cancer in June. Charlie entered my life in October 2020--a stray from Inglewood, CA--and together we forged a bond that healed our respective souls.

Fire Destroyed Itasca Animal Shelter,"On April 20th, 2024 Itasca, Texas suffered a massive structure fire. The fire engulfed the animal shelter building, leaving nothing but the concrete kennels & tin roof. Thanks to the quick & selfless actions of the Itasca Animal Control officers & Hill County Sheriff officers, all of the dogs were rescued & taken to safety.
Sadly, the Itasca Animal Shelter is a total loss.
As a small rural community with little resources, having a shelter was a big blessing. Two years ago, the decision to open a shelter & have an established Animal Control was brought on by a large population of stray, dumped & roaming dogs.

"Help the Kidd Family rebuild their horse, cow barn","On January 12, our brand new almost-finished barn and all its contents (30 ton of hay, tractor and farm machinery) burnt to the ground. While very thankfully no animals or people were harmed, the barn is a total loss.
Here’s some history so you understand what we’re asking for: We started out purchasing this land from my grandparents. My grandparents purchased the land from my grandmother’s parents when they moved here from Utah. My great grandmother had a vision that this land would provide food for people in desperate times. They had been beet farmers in Utah. Although beet farming was not successful here in Oregon, they maintained hope that the land would be a place that could provide basic needs to our family, friends and community.
My grandparents experienced some life-changing health events which forced my grandpa into early retirement. He and my grandmother had cows and he repaired and sold tractors. They lived a modest but loving life. As my grandfather developed Lewy Body Dementia, my family began to accept more responsibility for managing the property. At his psychiatrist’s advice we tried to maintain life as he knew it - which meant bringing cows back to the property. We easily began to love the cows as he did. They are beef cows raised on grass hay and pasture. They are loved and respected in their life and honored in their death.",3976.0,80000.0,619.0,https://images.gofundme.com/BswLuLrrBNfYeLeit0iurxema50=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/77756541_1705960359635528_r.jpeg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-kidd-family-rebuild-hay-barn-animal-shelter?qid=54a80c3c35ee527d2dd231684a3b567b,"Wood, Barn, Shed",1
INKA our beloved adopted Ukrainian dog needs medical care!,"Good day to all people WorldWide who might read this story,

A few years ago just when the war started between Russia and Ukraine, we adopted INKA from the animal shelter in Kiev! She survived two bomb attacks from the Russian army and since the moment she lived with us, she started a new life experiencing BIG love from both Anna and me Peter. 

Anna was in Poland in the past for years animal inspector. She saved a lot of animal (dog)lives and even saved several years ago MAYDAY…a once well known dog in Poland! Thanks to Anna’s intervention years ago with the help of other people, the ‘owner’ of MAYDAY was convicted to prison for one year. It was the first ever conviction in Polish court against animal abuse. At Google information can be found about the court case when one searches for Anna Stengert and Mayday.

Help Stray Kittens Get Vet Care,"Hello!

A few weeks ago, a mama cat (probably no more than a year old herself) turned up on a neighbor’s porch and had a litter of 6 kittens. My neighbor brought them in because it was during that last bunch of 90+ degree days, and I’m helping take care of them. They’re almost 4 weeks old now, have their own room, and everyone is doing well. Unfortunately, one of the kittens developed conjunctivitis (pink eye) and it’s spread to some of the other kittens.

We have already contacted Oregon Humane, Multnomah County Animal Shelter, and Cat Adoption Team, plus a couple of the veterinarian offices I’ve gone to with my own cats.

Save SOS Animal Shelter: Urgent Help Needed,"The grim reality is that SOS is at risk of closing due to the high costs of operations. Our hope is that animal lovers everywhere will see our story and help us keep our doors open. SOS Animal Shelter - a no-kill facility - has been open since 1981. A place to house the stray cats and dogs of Enterprise and the surrounding areas. In the last few years our funds have dwindled tremendously while our need to take in more animals has not slowed down. Several months ago we had to slow down our intake process because our medical bills continued to rise. We tried only taking in owner surrenders, pulling only from pounds but when the injured kitten or emaciated dog comes into our doors; how can we say no. An intake fee of $40.00 only goes so far when the animal needs so much more. We had an emergency business meeting, and we only have enough to sustain 2 more months. Then we will have to let our paid staff go. What happens to the animals? All of the area shelters are full. There is no easy answer but for some of these animals, SOS has become their home and staff their family. For example, Duke the bulldog survivor of the ALL BREEDS fire that took one of our beloved rescuer's, Ms. Jane. He has lived at SOS since then and he has become one of our most well-known dogs. Ghost is another well-known dog who has helped many of his friends become adoptable dogs who have found loving homes. Ghost is a semi feral dog, but he greets everyone with his ice blue eyes and a smile. As he has grown comfortable, SOS is his home. We have several feral cats that have taken comfort in our cattery and keep critters from coming into our cat rooms and spreading bacteria that mice carry. This is their home. This will all end if we don't get the financial help we desperately need. We spent several hours looking over some of our costs and even though we have been very fortunate that the community supplies us with much needed donations such as bleach, dog food, cat food and all the extras to make our money go to the vetting of our animals. The reality is as vetting prices and utilities have increased our monetary donations have not. Each month we hope the next month will be better but it's not and now our account has dwindled down to making us look at the cold hard truth; we may not make it to next month. We hoped we would never have to make this post, but we truly and desperately need your help to keep our shelter open.",35450.0,20000.0,331.0,https://images.gofundme.com/mrCVhc5DlnQC3cW4r_kF8BKa5T0=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/83852357_1730864550949658_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-sos-animal-shelter-urgent-help-needed?qid=8dbb1d69a9c640018f0c886ef3ef1c83,"Dog, Carnivores, Snout, Poster, Working animal, Canidae, Pet Supply, Advertising, Graphic design",1

Help Archer Get the Medical Care He Needs,"Hello All!

A little about our family…My name is Shelbi. My husband Phillip and our son Pj have a Belgian Malinois named Archer. We got Archer when we moved to Colorado 9 years ago and he was just 8 weeks old. My husband has been at Copper since 2016 and I have been working at the hospital since 2018. We are very outdoorsy people and we have been able to provide that type of lifestyle for Archer his whole life and even though he’s 9 anyone who has ever met him says he still acts like a puppy.

For the past month Archer has been very sick with lots of GI related issues. Since mid August we have spent $3k alone trying to find out what’s wrong with him. We had masses tested for cancer and bloodwork sent to Texas. He’s been on many different meds non stop since his symptoms started. We had an ultrasound done as well. We have tried every avenue to get him better but the next step is to get a liver biopsy.

At only three years old, she should be running around carefree — but instead, she is facing a devastating diagnosis.

There is hope. With the right care, medication, and treatment, Rosie can still live a full, happy life.

Since 2015, I’ve been behind the camera and the keyboard for countless Rowan County Animal Shelter photos and videos—working to give the cats and kittens there a voice and a chance at life. Volunteering with the shelter and rescues has been one of the greatest joys of my life.

What most people don’t know is that I’ve also been quietly fighting serious health issues for years. In the past eight months, I’ve been hospitalized four different times, each for long stretches. Unfortunately, my health will only continue to decline. It has been exhausting and frightening, but what has made it even harder is the toll it’s taken on our family. My husband, Twinnion, has missed a great deal of work to care for me and take me to appointments. He’s used all of his vacation time, and now much of that time off is unpaid.

Support Dooey-Doo's Life-Saving Surgery,"About Doo!
Our fantastically mustached little man, ""Dooey-Doo"" was rescued from our local animal shelter 11 years ago. Part of a Star Wars themed litter, his shelter nickname was Darth Mittens. We knew immediately he was ours when he climbed right into our laps and purred away, and we took him home that day. Even as an kitten, he brought comfort to everyone and everything: a few days after bringing him home, we learned that he had bonded with an abused, very timid black kitten named Sam, who had withdrawn once Doo left with us... So of course, we went back for him, too!

Now, 11 years old, he is still just as sweet of a cat who thinks he might be part dog and part human. Possibly also part macaroni, given his love for sleeping in tupperware bins. He comes trotting in when you call him, leads us to the fridge at meal times, relaxes and hands you his paws for his mani-pedis, and snuggles his human-mom every night... Curled against her side, with his head and arm on her chest, like a person. His favorite past time is rocking with her in the rocking chair, one paw on each shoulder.

Save PALS Animal Shelter,"Pets and Animals Life Shelter or (PALS), is a no kill shelter that houses over 200 pets and animals from the standard cats and dogs, more exotic animals like iguanas, pigs and horses. Since 1999 we have not only provided a temporary safe haven (while seeking forever homes) for our animals, but also provided the community information, and low cost spaying and neutering for furry family members. However, we are struggling to provide enough food for all of our animals, and keep up the daily operation cost. We have done numerous food drives, and many have donated their time to assisting us, but it seems we are still falling just short of our goal. With 15,000 dollars our plan is to first provide a new roof for our animals, (since the current one is damaged beyond repair) totaling in 8,500 dollars. Next we would like to buy enough food for the animals for the entire month costing 2,900 dollars. And finally the daily operation cost of the shelter runs at 4,000 dollars a month. Ultimately if the shelter is not able to come up with these funds by the end of June 30th, we will be forced to close down for good. This is why it is so crucial that this campaign be successful.

Help me save my little pug ❤️,"My dog’s name is Pipsu, and she is a 7-year-old pug who has ascites (abdominal fluid build-up). The diagnostic test to determine the cause costs €900, after which a suitable treatment can be found. From what I’ve read online, the diagnostic process is not only expensive but also complicated.

She has always been a very energetic, curious, and friendly dog. At the moment, she is lethargic and seeks solitude away from people, which is completely unlike her.

Pipsu eats and drinks very little, and she is experiencing both constipation and diarrhoea. When we mentioned her digestive problems to the vet, we didn’t receive any medication recommendations or advice.",166.25,2000.0,68.0,https://images.gofundme.com/b3q_6OwieyU1pPsidyxIIREK0P4=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93063257_1753525890350390_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-me-save-my-little-pug?qid=db1df4815572813bdc727e97ce0d912e,"Dog, Pug, Vertebrate, Carnivores, Snout, Working animal, Puppy, Terrestrial animal, Toy dog, Fur",0
Help Friends of Madera Shelter replace our stolen van,"Hi, I'm Kirsten Parksion, and I'm reaching out to you to support the Friends of Madera Animal Shelter. We had one of our vans stolen.

Any help you can provide is greatly appreciated and will go directly to replacing our van.

First, the local Humane Society. My Dad had a soft spot in his heart for animals.

He had lost 12lbs since his last appointment at the end of May. The vet noticed his eyes were bloodshot, and yellow so he took him for immediate labs and x-rays. His labs came back, and his liver and kidney are not doing well. The vet wanted to transfer and admit Bear to a facility with a higher level of care to get IV fluids and be monitored overnight, but we just cannot afford that. The vet was concerned about Leptospirosis and Blastomycosis due to the fact that Bear likes to drink the water that pools in the backyard from storms, even though we try our best to keep him away from it.

Pit Stop meets Community Cats - Spay / Neuter!,"Pit Stop meets Community Cats – Please help us to spay / neuter community pets in need!  Every donation will help save countless lives!


The Pit Stop program is a free spay / neuter program offered to the Paterson, NJ community to decrease the growing culture of Pit bull breeding and fighting.  We have recently implemented a Community Cats program that goes hand-in-hand with Pit Stop, offering a free spay / neuter program aimed at low income families to decrease the unintentional breeding and abandonment of cats.  Every $150 saves another dog, and every $75 saves another cat from a life of trauma.


This area is low income and is saturated with dog breeding and fighting, overwhelmingly with Pit bulls.  The number of stray and feral cats is shocking, as breeding is overwhelmingly unintentional and due to a lack of spay / neuter resources.  The lack of resources and humane education has created a growing and already large problem.


Pit bull puppies and kittens are handed out on the street or sold.  Many end up in animal control, and many more end up on the streets, tied in yards or involved in dog fighting (cats / kittens are sadly used as bait).  It has been our experience that very few are spayed or neutered.  The lack of spay / neuter also creates additional concerns medically and behaviorally causing families to surrender their pets or put them outside. 


Many residents are open to spay / neuter options but are not actively seeking these options.  That is where WE come in.  Participants will have their pets picked up and brought to a veterinarian for a spay or neuter, as many residents do not have access to transportation.  RBARI will provide any other needed medical care, returning the pet with food and supplies to continue to build our relationship with the community.  


The goal is to promote proper humane education and decrease breeding.  Over time our hope is to change the outlook of the community with regards to animal welfare.  This program will save hundreds of dogs and cats from a live of pain and suffering.

Save Almost Home Animal Shelter,"Almost Home animal shelter is on the verge of closing its doors and needs EVERYONES help to stay open and save lives!

You may not be aware but Almost Home has taken over for the city of Southfield Animal control back in 2006 where over 80% of dogs and cats were euthanized prior to us being here. Almost Home has proven to the community that we can function as a true Never-kill shelter with only 28 kennels and lack of space, working in run-down conditions, we managed to make it work for over 12 years.

Founded by a mother and daughter they made it their mission to embrace the never-kill philosophy and managed to save more than 5,000 dogs and cats from euthanasia and helped them find loving, fur-ever homes with proper medical care and rehabilitation.

The shelter runs strictly donations, and relies heavily on staff and volunteers. Unfortunately, donations and adoption fees have not been enough to cover the expenses involved in maintaining the shelter. We are in the biggest deficit we have ever been in, and struggling not to close our doors.

We are so grateful for the new renovations currently being done at our building by the city of Southfield, but this project has taken 9 months, and created the inability to focus on fundraising. Our yards have been removed and has forced us to walk each individual dog in the most brutal winter as well as blistering summer. Many of our staff members have become burnt out, leading to exhaustion, frustration, and emotional distress.

Being used to seeing our dogs run around in the yard enjoying life, and getting exercise and attention, is no longer and has upset us all putting us in a sense of helplessness and despair. Several long term staff have left Almost Home due to the difficult working conditions. We have had to hire extra help causing our payroll to sky rocket. Management and the founders have had to step in and focus the majority of their time caring for the dogs and cats, and creating extra special events to get them adopted instead of raising money and keeping up with our social media sites.

Since we moved to a temporary location there has been many dogs feeling the stress of the move as well leading them to fighting with each other, breaking out of their kennels, diarrhea, depression and confusion.

This location has no internet, no phones, and many people are unaware of where we are, creating less communication for donations. We miss our everyday donors who would come to our shelter to greet our dogs, cats, and staff bringing us monetary donations as well as physical donations. Many of these people were so impressed with our shelter and our hard work that they would do fundraisers themselves at their place of employment, birthday parties, bar/bat mitzvahs, and the list goes on.

April May and June are our most dry times for donations...passing the holiday months where people are more giving. Putting together the chaos of the 9 months and the dry season has put us into financial debt.

Funds will be used to cover operating expenses, veterinary bills, supplies, advertising, food, medications, rental of the cat trailer and the storage unit, etc. and ensure the survival of the shelter.

If you help, you will not only be saving the shelter but the thousands of abandoned dogs and cats who might never receive a second chance at life without the help from Almost Home.

Please share this campaign to help spread the message. We care for over 80 + dogs and cats at one given time. Our vets won’t see us anymore if we do not pay our bills. Please help!

We are on the verge of closing down as our medical expenses has risen. All of our vets are asking for money and we simply cannot pay them which means we may have to close down. Our payroll has sky rocketed due to our circumstances of needing extra help. We appreciate our volunteers for all their hard work and compassion for Almost Home. However, they cannot be consistent as they have to work and support their families.

We are now at our new renovated shelter begging for funds to keep it going. We are begging for your help! We don’t want to let our animals down and we know you don’t want to either.

Please if you can help make your tax-deductible donation today!

She even gave ""paws"". This gesture and her collar, indicated that she once had an owner. She had obviously left him because she didn't feel safe there. Or had she simply been abandoned?

Help Us Create An Off Grid No Kill Animal Shelter,"Hi, my name is Bionca and my son’s name is Carter. We are a well known Full-time camping family called @Offthegridwithakid on social media. Our story has been featured in major outlets, magazines, newspapers and podcasts. My story of single motherhood, entrepreneurship, homeschooling and rescuing animals while living in a camper has been said to be an inspiring journey that moves people joyously and encourages them to step outside their comfort zones to create their own definition of success and achieve it no matter what! More on our full story: https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/inspirational-stories/a27166248/bionca-smith-single-mom-travel-rv/ Our Situation  We are full time influencers and we sell our own products and services. In our spare time, we love privately camping with our rescue dogs and horses but after passionately using our resources and platform for the greater good and learning about the stray animal crisis, kill shelters and kill pens for horses… We feel called to use our resources and platform for the greater good and start an animal rescue sanctuary campground. This is a big responsibility but it’s something we know we’re being called to do because the vision and steps have been given to us and we’ve been getting all the signs that it’s time for us to step up and just do it.  Our Mission  Off The Grid Animal Sanctuary and Retreat is a new nonprofit forming; a rescue and safe haven, and campground to be built for stray puppies, kittens are neglected farm animals. We primarily have experience with rescuing puppies and horses but we’ve had all sorts of animals throughout childhood and beyond. We currently live in a leased RV with 4 rescue dogs (2 of our own and 2 are foster but the only thing that is stopping us from keeping them is not having enough room for them as they’ve grown. Of course we are also attached after rehabilitating them from a young age. We are raising funds to get this start-up off the ground so that we can canvas the streets in the rain or shine to raise awareness and build an animal sanctuary with shelter that can provide immediate safety, treatment, and affection to the animals we want to continue to rescue off the streets in Houston. We are seeking volunteers and homeowners willing to foster and we want to celebrate the people that will foster our rescues and gift them care packages for the animals we don’t have room for at the sanctuary.  Our primary goal is to help abandoned animals get access to a safe and comforting space to regain their strength and socialize as we get to know their personality and find the perfect match for their furever home. ❤️ Working together in our growing foster community, we will gather, and network to find resources, transportation, and reliable and responsible placement for each rescued animal.  Click here to join our new local foster group:  Camping and walking on trails with dogs is celebrated and encouraged whenever possible. Our long term goal is to build up the campground where visitors will have the opportunity to bond and camp with animals in the foster program before they consider adoption.  We aim to cultivate a community of generous positive individuals who are passionate about being of service and helping this organization grow. Will you join us in creating Off The Grid Animal Sanctuary & Retreat? We invite you to watch us grow and camp with us someday soon.  We will be documenting each milestone on our new Instagram page.

For Animals shelters in Ireland and we also help sick animal,"Hello everyone. We have known for a long time that animal shelters in Ireland are overcrowded. In recent years, animal homelessness has increased 200%.

Unfortunately, due to irresponsible people, such animals are deprived of love, homes and loving families. We know we can't help much, but at least a little. We are Polish people who live in Ireland and we love helping animals. Me and my friend decided to set up a GoFundMe and help cover at least a little of the costs of shelters in Ireland. We want to try to cover the costs of vet bills for animal treatment, buy food and necessary medicines, and buy necessary cleaning products. That's why we created this collection.

Help Patrick Mahomes Walk Again,"Hello , my name is Patrick Mahomes, yes I’m named after the football player, don’t blame me blame my dad. About a week ago, a car hit me while I was outside my home which lead to 3 out of my 4 legs being fractured, and an injury on one of my ears which can lead to my head. I went to the hospital and was told I’d need surgery, physical therapy, and other stuff if I’d ever want to walk on my 4s again. We didn’t have enough money for all my procedures, treatments, medications, and surgery out here so we have been driving down to Tijuana, Mexico. The first surgery didn’t go well and we hope to get serviced out here in the bay instead. My dad doesn’t have to fully cover everything that’s to come and for that he is grateful for any help.

— Mahomes is a great puppy. He’s had a really hard life. He’s been to the dog park once. He’s felt real grass and dirt only a couple of times. He is sensitive and careful with who touches him due to the accident. It has been hard, especially driving down to another country. I’ve put my job at risk, I’ve lost my home, car, I’ve maxed out my CC’s, even the care credit vet clinics provide, and much more but all I really care about are my dogs. If you’d like to fully take care of his surgery, or feel like he’s yours after helping me out, we can come to an agreement.

Glebe Farm Animals Support Fund,"Glebe Farm is a free entry community farm in Congleton, Cheshire. We have a small collection of farm animals, many of which have come to us from rescue situations or are living out their retirement with us. Normally we enjoy a lovely busy summer with lots of visitors buying treats to feed to the animals or enjoying a tractor ride. These funds go to look after and feed all our animals but this year due to Covid 19 restrictions our funds and visitor numbers have been drastically reduced. We just need a little bit of help to get us through this latest lockdown, we have big plans for the future to develop into a free to enter countryside and farm education centre and will run paid encounters, school visits, parties and holiday clubs. This will secure the future of the farm but at the moment we are unable to implement any of this due to the ongoing lockdown restrictions. 

If you would like to contribute we would be so grateful and all money raised will go directly to feed and care for the animals, as well as make some much needed improvements to their housing. We will post regular updates on our Facebook page, Instagram and are setting up our own YouTube channel with educational videos about our animals. We are also launching our brand new animal sponsorship scheme which will be up and running soon on our website

SAVE UPLAND ANIMAL SHELTER!,"Upland Animal Services and volunteers have created and sustain one of the most beloved animal shelters in the Inland Empire.   This progress is at risk and the shelter could become a high-kill ""dog pound"" without your help!

Due to financial challenges within the City of Upland, Upland Animal Services' budget was cut drastically on July 27, 2015. This represents a 41% reduction over last year’s budget.

Friends of Upland Animal Shelter is initiating a major fundraising program to ensure that this cut does not negatively affect the quality of care of homeless pets awaiting their forever homes at the shelter.  

Without additional funding, this cut will cause significant impacts to Upland Animal Services' ability to care for animals taken into the shelter, retain and hire quality animal control personnel and shelter staff, keep volunteers and community partners, and maintain the service levels that citizens of Upland and nearby communities have come to value. 

The City has said that shelter hours could be reduced and staff could be laid off as early as October. However, these changes would only account for a part of the total reduction and more will be necessary.

Since opening in its current location in 2010, the shelter has consistently been underfunded and operates at an incredibly low net cost of approximately $500,000 per year.   For example, kennels are primarily cleaned by individuals on work release on most days.  While the shelter is grateful for the help, this arrangement has some serious drawbacks.  One is that having a ""revolving door"" of different, untrained kennel attendants each day means animals are at a higher risk for spread of disease.   Another is that on some days, no work release individuals are assigned to the shelter.  On those days, shelter staff are diverted away from their primary roles to instead clean kennels, which means other services, programs, and initiatives suffer. 

Despite these challenges, the shelter has high adoption rates and low euthanasia rates.   In 2007, 680 animals were adopted and 635 were euthanized.  This represented a 47% euthanasia rate.  Contrast this with 2014 where 1416 animals were adopted and 416 were euthanized.  The euthanasia rate was reduced to 23%.  The statistical difference is astounding, and the lives saved are real.  We want to see this progress continue!

However, cutting almost half the budget will devastate this progress and ultimately result in the deaths of healthy, adoptable pets.  We need your help to avoid this intolerable and unbearable outcome. 

CBSLA Coverage of Outcome:



Our goal is to raise enough money to create a sustainable revenue stream to maintain and improve the current adoption rates and service level within the community, while further lowering the euthanasia rate.   In addition, new programs such as sponsoring spaying/neutering and TNR (Trap, Neuter & Release) need to be developed and implemented to minimize the number of animals entering the shelter each year. 
We sincerely thank everyone who came out to support the shelter at the recent rally and voice their concerns at the City Council meeting on July 27.  We also thank those who have found us on Facebook and have expressed their support from afar.  This show of support is amazing and we are even more motivated than ever to find ways to assist the Upland Animal Shelter in helping the animals in our community.

Support Enzo's Urgent Eye Surgery,"I rescued my Enzo from a local animal shelter in Tampa almost three years ago. He had been at the shelter for over a month and was already completely blind. He was found as a stray on the street, covered in fleas, and had no fur. Unfortunately, being held at a not-for-profit shelter, they weren’t able to do much or know much about the state of his sight. I knew adopting him would already be a big responsibility, especially since I was just starting college. But from the moment I saw him, I knew he was the one. He was a happy and overall very healthy pup. I did as much as I could to give him the best life possible while I was attending school.

Recently, I took him to his first veterinary eye specialist to make sure that his eyes were healthy, despite the blindness, and if there was anything I could be doing to enhance his health. Unfortunately, the vet informed me that he had a very severe case of glaucoma (which caused his eyes to become enlarged) and was dealing with chronic pain. The vets told me that he was likely born this way and there wasn’t much I could’ve done early on for him. They told me while there is medication for his condition, in his case, they would prove to be ineffective. The only option would be full removal of his eyes. I was so heartbroken when I heard the news and was devastated to hear he’s been suffering all this time. Luckily the surgery has a very fast recovery time and he will be back to normal within a month.",2880.0,2800.0,80.0,https://images.gofundme.com/zhYbCL306-5BQVMDAk76uWjFDsk=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/92697683_175253222447913_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-enzos-urgent-eye-surgery?qid=b7bb97e73049109cac4a80eaef1ddecc,"Dog, Vertebrate, Carnivores, Snout, Working animal, Canidae, Pet Supply",1

Help Archer Get the Medical Care He Needs,"Hello All!

My husband has been at Copper since 2016 and I have been working at the hospital since 2018. We are very outdoorsy people and we have been able to provide that type of lifestyle for Archer his whole life and even though he’s 9 anyone who has ever met him says he still acts like a puppy.

For the past month Archer has been very sick with lots of GI related issues. Since mid August we have spent $3k alone trying to find out what’s wrong with him. We had masses tested for cancer and bloodwork sent to Texas. He’s been on many different meds non stop since his symptoms started. We had an ultrasound done as well. We have tried every avenue to get him better but the next step is to get a liver biopsy.

Save Periwinkle: Urgent Medical Help Needed,"Hello friends and family!! Thank you for your generosity. Here's what's happened: Periwinkle is my indoor only, tuxedo cat around 2 and half years old. I love her dearly. I adopted her from the Oakland Animal Shelter. This past weekend she has been very lethargic, and had a low appetite. On 8/11/2025 Periwinkle had no interest in eating at all, so I took her into the OakVet Animal Specialty Hospital as an emergency, and additionally set up an appointment at the soonest available time with Periwinkle's regular doctor at The Cheshire Cat Clinic. The initial check up showed she had a 103.8 high fever, was dehydrated, loss of fat and muscle, and was breathing hard and fast. The visiting Vet (DVM) suggested a General blood test, Chest x-ray, and Ultrasound of abdomen cavity. The blood test revealed a high white blood cell count indicative of infection and the x-ray revealed both of Periwinkle's lungs seemed to be consolidated. The DVM attempted to collect and sample any fluid outside of the lung but was not able to collect any fluid, because very little fluid was present at the time, leading for the DVM to believe Periwinkle was suffering from pneumonia. I was allowed to take Periwinkle home with instructions to administer antibiotics and monitor for signs of improvement (normal breathing rate). Periwinkle was still not interested in eating and very resistant to any syringe feeding. With much effort I was able to syringe her some meat flavored baby food and syringe the antibiotics, though this was very difficult. At home, Periwinkle was very clearly breathing hard, and struggling to be comfortable, though her breathing rate stayed the same and she was mobile and still very spunky. On 08/12/2025, at midnight I decided bring Periwinkle back into the OakVet Hospital to be hospitalized.",668.0,4500.0,51.0,https://images.gofundme.com/p-aFfvycYThgTaPY9j2FVnJukiY=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93602035_1755054360587561_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-periwinkle-urgent-medical-help-needed?qid=b7bb97e73049109cac4a80eaef1ddecc,"Cat, Felidae, Felinae, Carnivores, Whiskers, Snout, Pet Supply, Fur, Domestic short-haired cat, Mesh",0

Valentine Needs your Support,"Valentine just celebrated her one-year birthday on Valentines Day. For Valentine this celebration was a true celebration of life. She beat distemper! But now just after her one year birthday, Valentine, was diagnosed with severe hip dysplasia and Osteoarthritis. She needs our help! The surgery is expensive and must be performed in Boise. PAS is asking you to rally behind Valentine! This girl is a fighter, she is full of life and is sincerely loved. Your contribution today will pay the direct medical expenses to help Valentine live a full and happy life. 

Valentine and her littermates were one of the litters of puppies that contracted distemper during the distemper crisis at PAS. This, then tiny puppy held on to life and survived a disease that is known to take over 80% of its victims. At one point poor Valentine was alone in quarantine.

Rescued for the Role,"Our journey to expanding all started with a rat named Luna. Luna was brought to me by the kind people who found her abandoned and left in a bucket with nothing but fish food to eat. After some time of creating a safe space for her she began showing interest in learning fun tricks for snacks and spending time with me. Luna was then chosen for the role on a very loved children’s show. This little life was tossed aside but when she was shown love and kindness she became a star!

I’m so excited for this next step in being able to provide a safe haven for animals in need. Ontario’s animal shelters are filled to the MAX.

Give Bruce a Chance at a Happy Senior Life,"Hi! My name is Bruce! I'm 9 years old and was recently rescued from Downey, a high-kill animal shelter in Los Angeles. The volunteers were really sweet and kind to me, advocating for me. You see, county shelters are overwhelmingly overcrowded, which leads to healthy and adoptable dogs being euthanized to make space for the incoming. And to most, I may not be considered desirable, since I'm a senior with health issues, the major one being skin. I suffer from dermatitis and have bleeding scabs all over my body, including my face and between my toes. Thanks to the volunteers, I caught the attention of my adoptive mother, and she saved me from euthanasia at the very last minute. However, it took a team, including Jenn & Bruce, to make this happen! My new mom could see past the health and skin issues; she was immediately drawn to the beauty and depth in my eyes. Although I lived a life of neglect (and then was discarded at a high-kill shelter), I still have a zest for life, wiggles in my butt, love cuddles, and just want to sit in your lap! They tell me that I deserve to live out the rest of my senior years with love, stability, and humans to call my own.",885.0,1500.0,31.0,https://images.gofundme.com/YYpeeoE9ohr8Gm5_8xgkntulnDo=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94210861_1756760816702239_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/give-bruce-a-chance-at-a-happy-senior-life?qid=05451dc5b43081aeb17b15534d4b4c3f,"Dog, Carnivores, Vertebrate, Snout, Working animal, Canidae, Nap, Sleep, Pet Supply, Dog Supply",0

Kitten Incubator for the Woodbury Animal Shelter,"The Woodbury Animal Shelter takes in many kittens through out the season that are extremely young, sick, and sometimes underdeveloped for their age. We get a lot of kittens with upper respiratory infections that need an enclosed area so they can get their medical treatments in a safe, less stressful environment. These kittens are too young to regulate their own body temperature.

They are hoping to be able to purchase a R-COM Pet Brooder. This particular incubator is highly recommended by other kitten rescue groups because of its features and reliability. It is also portable, which is important for us to transport kittens home with us in the evenings since they require 24hr care.

All monies raised will be donated directly to the shelter & applied towards the fund for the incubator. Should more money be raised than needed, it will be used to purchase items off of the shelters Amazon Wish List (see below).

Help save Fatima Walthert's Rescue Animal Shelter,"My dear friend Fatima Walthert and her husband have been running  their rescue animal shelter and sanctuary (7500 m2 property) called Patitas Galapagueñas  in the Galapagos, Ecuador since  2016.  For the last month Ecuador has been hit with extreme heavy rains, which have damaged their property fencing to the point where the local government is threatening to shut down the rescue shelter immediately if the fencing is not completely redone ASAP. The government has informed Fatima that they will also take away all their animals ( 30 dogs, 2 pigs, 2 cats). Their property is 7500m2, the fencing price estimate without concrete work and labour is  $14 550. The total price with labour and concrete pouring work is $25 000. / Please see attached scans / This situation is extremely hard, because  due to the worldwide Covid pandemic Fatima and her husband have lost their income one year ago.

Emily and Her Young Son Need Urgent Support,"This is Emily and her young son.

Emily is a devoted single mother who has always worked hard to provide for her family. But for the first time in her life, she is facing an impossible situation. After 8 months of tirelessly searching for work with countless applications, interviews, and no offers. She has exhausted every resource. Her unemployment benefits ended 3 months ago, and despite trying other avenues to earn income, nothing has been enough to keep up with their living expenses.

Today, Emily is 3 months behind on rent, with utilities, phone service, and other bills piling up.

Help Murphy Thrive in His Forever Home,"Murphy was rescued from Prince George’s County (Maryland) animal shelter in January 2025, just before he was due to be euthanized because the shelter was physically out of space to house the animals in its care. We don’t know what life was like for Murphy before the shelter, but we do know that he was never taught how to be a happy, healthy dog.

From the start, Daisy’s Legacy knew that Murphy faced a hard road ahead. He needed stability, structure, and patience – and those things aren’t easy to come by these days. Daisy’s Legacy went above and beyond for Murphy! When they put the call out that he needed a soft place to land, I offered Murphy a temporary home. It was during this time – maybe the day it was raining and I thought we’d pop out for a quick potty, but Murphy doesn’t mind the rain and oh there were so many great sniffs so surely we could walk for 45 minutes! – that I fell in love with his sweet heart and curious, loving eyes.",1448.0,4000.0,68.0,https://images.gofundme.com/rqvh7lWd6g71K76S7NHC_ZWyiUg=/720x405/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vgGkbF5DmQw/0.jpg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-murphy-thrive-in-his-forever-home?qid=05451dc5b43081aeb17b15534d4b4c3f,"Dog, Carnivores, Snout, Working animal, Canidae, Pet Supply, Pit bull, American Pit Bull Terrier, Whiskers",1

Hilf unserem kleinen Spock wieder frei atmen zu können,"Hallo, mein Name ist Wanjuscha. Gemeinsam mit meinem Mann, meinen zwei Kindern und unseren beiden Katzen Spock und Fofoinha möchte ich euch unsere Geschichte erzählen.
Im Oktober 2024 haben wir Fofoinha in Portugal von der Straße gerettet, nachdem ihre Mutter sie zurückgelassen hatte. Damit sie nicht alleine ist, haben wir im April 2025 Spock aus dem Tierheim zu uns geholt. Von der ersten Minute an waren die beiden unzertrennlich.
Doch kurze Zeit später begannen die Sorgen: Spock bekam große Probleme beim Atmen. Er kann nicht richtig mauzen, kaum schnurren und schläft fast nur noch auf dem Rücken, weil er sonst keine Luft bekommt. Selbst so schnarcht er ständig, verschluckt sich oder hat kleine Atemaussetzer. Es bricht uns jedes Mal das Herz, ihn so zu sehen.
Unsere Tierärztin überwies uns an die HNO-Abteilung der Kleintierklinik Leipzig. Nur unter Narkose kann festgestellt werden, was ihm genau fehlt – und wahrscheinlich wird direkt eine Operation notwendig sein. Die Kosten dafür belaufen sich auf 3.000 bis 4.000 €. Für uns als Familie ist das alleine nicht zu schaffen.",477.75,1680.0,41.0,https://images.gofundme.com/U0EX5KyvwT6a1UN1DQU18s9Z0dc=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/93905855_1755903468299990_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/hilf-unserem-kleinen-spock-wieder-frei-atmen-zu-konnen?qid=b7bb97e73049109cac4a80eaef1ddecc,"Cat, Felidae, Whiskers, Felinae, Carnivores, Vertebrate, Snout, Fur, Close-up, Terrestrial animal",0
Malee Animal Shelter (formerly Mabprachan),"Malee Animal Shelter in Chanthaburi, Thailand is owned by Thai native Mali and England native, Derek. To say these two have dedicated their lives to care for stray, sick, or abandoned animals is an understatement.
￼
MAS homes over 500 dogs and more than 50 cats. Besides Mali and Derrik, the shelter  has one full time employee, Jenny, and they have a stray (pun intended) volunteer from time to time. The rest of the time, they are caring for these animals on their own; morning to night. The funds are limited to say the least. They do the best they can to buy food and medications with donations that they receive.
￼
Most of the dogs roam free, un-caged, in large enclosures. This is very good way for the dogs to receive regular exercise and allows the dogs socialize with each other as well as with people. This does, however, become a problem during feeding times. Even the most docile of dogs can be food-aggressive. Mapbrachen has plans of extending their facilities specifically for feeding times. 
￼
The shelter has also aided in supplying spay and neuter assistance in some local communities. Our goal is to begin spaying and neutering many of the stray dogs on the streets. The rate that the stray dogs reproduce is staggering. Many end up in the shelters while many end up dead. We are hoping, through education and example, to encourage more people to spay or neuter their own pets and to join in the effort to reduce the number of homeless dogs in Chanthaburi.

With Bear's Vet Costs,"Our baby boy is sick :( I noticed he wasn't acting like himself the last few days, he was looking very sad and started to look a little thin so I took him to the vet on 7/25. He had lost 12lbs since his last appointment at the end of May. The vet noticed his eyes were bloodshot, and yellow so he took him for immediate labs and x-rays. His labs came back, and his liver and kidney are not doing well. The vet wanted to transfer and admit Bear to a facility with a higher level of care to get IV fluids and be monitored overnight, but we just cannot afford that. The vet was concerned about Leptospirosis and Blastomycosis due to the fact that Bear likes to drink the water that pools in the backyard from storms, even though we try our best to keep him away from it. The test for Lepto came back negative, so the next step is to test for the Blastomycosis which is a $250 urine test.

Support Buster's Recovery Journey,"on a saturday night my boyfriend and i were on our way to dave n busters down on columbus blvd. on the way down there was a lady stopped on the side of the road with a full grown pit jumping up on her car. we pull over to help. we notice a puppy on the side in a target bag. i instantly ran over to see if i was seeing things or not. the second he climbed on to my lap i knew i could not let go. i did not want to separate them, so i called everyone i knew to keep both dogs until i could figure out what to do. we couldn’t bring the big one back because we didn’t know how he was with other big dogs. (patrick already has dog and we didn’t want to up his dog or the other dog in danger.) so we brought him to the ACCT Philly. If it was someone’s pets they would be safe there. as we pulled up i could not let the puppy go to shelter. he was skin and bones and i could not let him grow up in a shelter. he was very clearly dumped there and I wasn’t letting the cruel world take his chances on him. we brought him home and gave him the world . there was very clearly something wrong with him i tried to get him a vet appointment but there was a misunderstanding. patrick was 3 minutes late and they would not see the puppy. i called and got him into one near my work for this saturday. i got home on Thursday and buster was not doing okay. we wasn’t eating, drinking, standing up. we rushed him to the a mount laurel animal hospital. where they instantly took him back and took care of him. within an hour they called us back to a room and the dr. told us our buster boy would need a blood transfusion as soon as possible. buster rbc count was 5 where normal dogs would be 30. this was clearly an emergency expense. if anyone can donate so this baby can live his wonderful life and come home and snuggle with mom and dad. if you can’t donate please share. i donate weekly to animal shelters all around and try to help where i can.

I hate asking anyone for help, but I've exhausted my savings and I don't know what else to do. Jules started getting sick about a week ago and has gone downhill really fast.

Help Hospitalized Boston Shelter Puppies Beat Parvovirus,"Over the weekend, three stray golden retriever puppies were found wandering the city streets of Boston. They were immediately taken in by the caring team at Boston Animal Control, who quickly discovered that two of the pups were suffering from the dreaded, and frequently fatal, parvovirus. The two sickly pups, both boys, are currently receiving expert inpatient care at MSPCA-Angell.

While both pups are expected to recover, their veterinary bills, which are staggering, have placed an untenable strain on the shelter’s very limited budget for veterinary care.

That big belly is an aggressive tumor called hemangiosarcoma. While waiting for pending oncology appointments, this mass doubled in less than a month. When I came home last Monday she was not at the door to greet me. I found her panting heavily and unable to move. Rushed her to a veterinary ER, who said she had lost half her blood volume into her tumor (she likely struggled to follow me to my doctors appt over her gate). After stabilized with pain control and blood transfusions, the surgeons at MedVet removed a 22 lb. tumor from her abdomen. Unfortunately, they found numerous bleeding nodules that had spread through the liver as well. She is being evaluated by oncology and they are developing a care plan, but her prognosis isn't good. She still has a joy for life, especially in her toys and femur bones, and finally regained her vacuum-cleaner appetite post-op.

Pennsville Animal Shelter Improvements,"Passion4Pets is seeking your help in raising funds for improvements to Pennsville Animal Shelter. Pennsville Animal Shelter is an intake shelter for Pennsville, LAC, Mannington, & Quinton. We are a NON-KILL shelter, meaning we do not euthanize for space. We have been working to make the shelter more efficient for our animals and operations. With that said, we are looking to update our outdoor dog kennels, inside cat kennels, and add a new shed for more storage.
 
Dog Kennels:
 
In 2020, we updated our indoor dog kennels.  This included floor to ceiling runs, new flooring and heating/cooling updates. We are hoping to do the same for the outside runs in 2021. The existing chain link fence kennels we currently have outdoors, allow the dogs to see the animal next to them which is not ideal for an animal in a shelter environment. After years of wear & tear, sharp edges have also started to appear which can cause dogs to get injured on the kennels. The health department has been working with us to allow time to have the kennels renovated, but we need assistance due to limited budget.
 
The estimated cost of our outdoor kennels renovations is $24,000
 

 
Our current cat room set up is not ideal for protecting our cats against airborne illnesses, as the fronts of the cages are open grates. We are looking to get fully enclosed cages to house animals during their quarantine period upon entering the shelter. The enclosed cages would ensure each cat is isolated, which will prevent any illnesses from spreading to the other cats within the shelter.
 
The estimated cost of our cat kennel renovations is $8,000
 


Lastly, we recently built a new office, which you may have noticed driving by. Our previous office trailer has to be demolished due to poor conditions. We are looking to place a shed where the previous office space was as we are outgrowing our current shed storage. We are so grateful for all donations we receive, but we have had to turn down donations due to lack of storage space.  This shed will allow us to accept large donations from retailers, such as Amazon, who recently donated over 250lbs of dry cat food.
 
The estimated cost of our shed is $3,000.
 

 
We are doing our best to provide what each and every animal needs during their stay at our shelter. Let’s make this shelter better for our lost animals, while they wait for their forever home. Whether you can donate or just share our fundraiser, we are so thankful for your support, and it does not go unnoticed.",,,1654.0,,https://www.gofundme.com/f/pennsville-animal-shelter-cage-upgrades?qid=24b7fcc1b75d583a5827127644c1df23,No image URL,0

Tiny Hit & Run Victim - Please help,"A tiny kitten was found after being hit by a car and left lying in the street.  Just a baby, beautiful and friendly, its unimaginable who could injure or see this sweet, defenseless kitten and keep going.  But, so many people did.  Finally, a passerby stopped to help.  The kitten was badly injured and this kind person took to Facebook to find help.  

Our Shelter Manager, Lori, received the photo and a text, ""This sweet baby was hit by a car...appears to have two broken legs...needs rescue today or will have to be euthanize. ""  Lori immediately called (twice) and her words were, ""Of course we will take her.  Let's get her right to the hospital.""   

We named her Dottie.  She was being temporarily held at a vet's office awaiting rescue, and we had her transported to Oradell Animal Hospital.  Dottie was covered in fleas and severely injured, but only looking for comfort in the arms of her rescuer as she purred happily, finally safe.  She was dehydrated and dull and needed to be placed on IV fluids and pain medication, under 24 hour observation for her injuries and possible internal trauma.  Dottie needs an ultrasound and x-rays to determine the extent of her injuries.  She has head trauma and will have an orthopedic consult and likely surgery.  Our goal is to attempt to save her leg, which she is unable to use right now.


So many people turned away and kept going after seeing Dottie lying there in need, but now we need to come together to save tiny Dottie!  We won't turn away thanks to each and every one of you.  Please help us to save Dottie, and her leg, so that she can live the full,  wonderful life she so deserves.  One look into these hopeful eyes and we knew that Dottie deserved a chance.

Support Bella's Battle with Cancer,"Many of Bella's followers have reached out asking if they could send me some money to help out and show their support. I was hesitant on creating one of these, just because I didn't want to seem like I was desperate or begging for money. But, so many of you said to make one, that I decided it wouldn't hurt.

All funds raised will go towards Bella's vet bills, medication costs, food, and eventually (and unfortunately) end of life costs. If any funds happen to remain left over, I will donate them to a local animal shelter.

As many of Bella's followers know, she was diagnosed with cancer in May. She was also diagnosed with thyroid disease in March. She has had a lot of vet visits and testing done. She's on multiple medications. She also requires more specialized types of food now as well. Vet bills alone have totaled $1,750 since March. That doesn't include all of her medication or foods, etc. The vet requires time of service payments, so there's no outstanding balance.

Save Mimi's Animal Shelter,"Mimi's Animal Shelter is the largest foster homes for rescued dogs and cats in Kuwait.
Unfortunately, after being laid off last February and since then she could not get any job , Mimi has to leave the country soon as she has no income and not enough donations to cover the costs of running the place.

sadly she can't take them with her as she does not have a place yet to live in herself in her home country. She is using all her retirement savings now to keep the place running  since she has been laid off but that's not going to last for another month or two.

Since we can no longer cover the costs or re-home the animals in kuwait, we need to immediately rehome 18 dogs and 20 cats abroad.

The animals need your support to cover the costs of their trips to new furever homes in usa or Canada through no kill rescues and shelters.

We are having an urgent campaign raising donations for two animal shelters—one in Ecuador and one in Colombia—that are facing a critical emergency.

This week, in Manta Ecuador they rescued three dogs in heartbreaking conditions:
• Two pregnant females abandoned in the garbage. One was unable to deliver, and sadly, her babies died in her womb. The other gave birth, but she is so weak that she cannot feed her newborns.
• A third dog was hit by a car and required emergency care.",20.0,1000.0,10.0,https://images.gofundme.com/ke4pZG-j-drOdGGK53D-o0ETfcs=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94890133_1759514600314509_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/an-urgent-case-a-dog-in-cucuta-fighting-for-his-life?qid=7043aa8d406d10bc6b86365fab710493,"Carnivores, Paw, Fur, Street dog, Canidae, Tail",0

Medical Care -25 Cats from hoarder,"In November, our shelter was inundated with 25 abandoned cats, rescued from a hoarding situation! A man that lived in our area, Armstrong,  committed suicide. He had informed a relative of his plans and they called us for help. The family was not close and really had no idea of what we should expect to find.  Our local sheriff's department gave us permission to go on the property and evaluate the situation.  Fearing for their well being in the cold freezing temps and knowing that the man had committed suicide perhaps as many as 4-5 days earlier, our team got our gear and headed over.  

 

We expected to find 4 or 5 cats. Upon arriving, we quickly realized there were many more!  The enclosures they were  kept in were a sort of rabbit hutch/greenhouse set up with 5-6 cats in each small enclosure.  They were living in their own excrement and had been for some time.  They had no food or water and were very frightened!  The process of rescuing them all proved to be much more difficult than weimagined as there were small cubbies in each unit  in which the cats were hiding.  After 3 days and approximately 30 hours with 2-4 volunteers at any given time we finally got them all out. All 25 of them, now fondly called the Armstrong 25!

 

Besides being frightened, hungry and thirsty, many were suffering from varying medical issues; some severe and others chronic.  We have since spayed/neutered and vaccinated each of them.  Many of them had odd health issues due to their living conditions and the amount of ammonia to which they were constantly exposed. Most of the cats are on the mend and becoming very friendly.  The amount that we have spent for their medical care alone is reaching  $2500.00 and this is with us utilizing our low cost spay and neuter clinic.  This does not take into consideration the cost of ongoing daily care of food, litter and maintenance veterinary care.  

 

The Emmet County Animal Shelter is an all volunteer non profit organization and our main focus is to rescue, rehabilitate and re-home which is our absolute intention in this case as well.  However, this situation is obviously on a grand scale and we are asking for funding assistance from any and all who would like to help offset the extraordinary costs involved.  Without our assistance, we are sure that these animals would not have been saved! We were happy to step up in this time of need but will be so grateful for your assistance in offsetting these additional expenses! Thank you for helping us save these poor abandoned animals!

 

Please contact the Shelter if you have any questions, would like any additional information or if you would like to come and visit the Armstrong 25!  They are doing better everyday but some will require care for a very long time.",1730.0,3000.0,3556.0,https://images.gofundme.com/JP7nKWSh8-8MdnhspEnEZNWuPew=/1200x900/https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/7743717_fb_1452188179.9158_funds.jpg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/Armstrong25?qid=c8c809e595ee1756937b94b8bd654c62,"Land lot, Backyard, Yard, Shed, Garden buildings",1

We feel that a Pavilion will improve the dogs chances of being adopted.

Banjo's Second Chance,"On the morning of July 1st, I stumbled upon an Instagram reel featuring Banjo--a doe-eyed, rambunctious doberman kenneled in the crowded Devore animal shelter. The caption explained that Banjo was in urgent need of rescue, as he was scheduled to be euthanized that afternoon at 2pm. Across Los Angeles and surrounding regions, the situation is dire: most shelters are exceeding capacity over 200%. This means that dogs surrendered by owners, the product of greedy backyard breeders, or the result of inadequate resources for spaying and neutering never get the opportunity to live full lives.

The comment section on Banjo's post was filled with pledges to contribute to his care, but as is understandable in these situations, there was difficulty in getting him out in time. As those who know me might be aware, I recently lost my soulmate rescue doberman, Charlie, to metastatic lung cancer in June. Charlie entered my life in October 2020--a stray from Inglewood, CA--and together we forged a bond that healed our respective souls. Though initially traumatized and shutdown, love and dedication enabled Charlie to blossom into a more confident dobie; her unconditional love left an indelible imprint on my heart.",1150.0,1200.0,77.0,https://images.gofundme.com/DqJwUvbDc7U9Q8SqTOzktnZ-nOc=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/92795157_1752780313466518_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/banjos-second-chance?qid=b7bb97e73049109cac4a80eaef1ddecc,"Dog, Carnivores, Vertebrate, Snout, Working animal, Canidae, Guard dog, Fur, Dobermann, Pet Supply",0
Help King Walk Again,"King is a resilient dog currently being cared for by the Kings County animal shelter after being rescued from a dangerous situation. Johnny found King trapped under a bridge in Layton, California, where he had been stuck in the river for days. Despite his ordeal, King has shown incredible strength and a will to survive. Unfortunately, he suffered a broken elbow and was also born with defects in his legs that require urgent medical attention.

King’s treatment plan involves multiple surgeries for both his front and back legs. The funds raised will help cover the cost of these surgeries, as well as medication, rehabilitation, and food during his recovery. The need is urgent—King requires immediate surgery to relieve his pain and give him the best chance at a healthy, happy life.

King’s story is one of survival and hope. Even after everything he’s been through, he remains strong-willed and eager to live.

Help get beds at South Los Angeles Animal Shelter,"About 3.3 million dogs go into U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year, and out of that, 3.3 million 670,000 are killed. While many shelters euthanize animals through injection of sodium pentobarbital, which is a quick and painless death, some shelters use inhumane methods to euthanize animals that not only allow more pain and suffering but are also not always immediately effective. Unfortunately, all of this happens because there are too many animals and not enough room in shelters. While in the care of the shelters, these dogs require basic niceties such as food and water.  But something that is often overlooked by many is their beds. Shelters have discovered that when dogs get quality rest, it reduces stress, and they behave better, making them more adoptable. A shelter can definitely be a stressful place, but with Karanda shelter beds, we can give them a comfortable environment until they can get a forever home. Karanda shelter beds are safe as they have a patented chew proof design with fabric edges that are protected inside the frame to reduce the risk of ingestion. They can also be used for any sized dog as they can hold up to 250 lbs, and they are easy to clean to help prevent diseases like canine distemper and parvo. You can help more dogs get adopted by donating to help get more Karanda shelter beds. Each bed costs $94, and any donation you could provide will help to get  Karanda shelter beds for the South Los Angeles Shelter as they currently require 110 Kuranda beds.

Gift Youmi with donation to help animals in need!,"As some of you know, I have been helping Kong Kong 2 House , a private animal shelter in Korea, with the support of PB and Chi Dog Rescue .

What it means to be a private animal shelter in Korea is you are constantly getting rescue calls about dogs being abused, having people dumping their dogs at the shelter or dog-meat traders stealing them overnight, all these WITHOUT any government funding. Remember these shelters are run by individuals who often times give up everything they have in order to stand by the animals and protect them (not euthanizing them).

The reason why I started helping dogs in Korea is that they are not only being abused but also being tortured for human consumption. Animal protection law in Korea is almost non-existent and these private shelters are desperate for international support.

Luna's heartworm treatment,"Hi everyone!
This is Luna or some may remember her name being Theresa. I adopted her from the La Porte animal shelter December 2024. Recently she has been having some health issues so we did some testing at the Deer Park Animal Shelter. Come to find out she has heart worms. When I adopted her they told me she was treated for heartworms, and without further instructions/information I assumed she was good to go. I was ignorant to the fact that she needed continued treatment for heartworms. So we have scheduled her to get rechecked and to move forward with the treatment, however many of you may know that heartworm removal/treatment doesn't come cheap. So I am asking if anyone would be so kind as to help me get this treatment taken care of for Luna that would be greatly appreciated.

Families will rent the food trucks for $50-$100 per month. 100% of the money will be used to cover vet costs, animal food, electricity etc. 

A self sustaining project that serves humans, animals, and education. 

On this property our volunteers can come visit donating books to the animal shelter. Locals can come and spend time with the abandoned animals, pick up a book, adopt a pet, grab some food, and play some soccer!! 

We are currently looking for the land around El Salvador. We are looking to begin construction 2-5 months from now. This will serve as a Murphslife volunteer spot where you can come to not only help build this project but teach English, play soccer with the kids, and spend time with the animals. 

LETS DO THIS!!

Milwaukee's NEWEST animal shelter!,"If you've heard about Rescue Gang, then you know how far we've come. Since our first intake in February, 2015, we have saved 138 animals out of a 2 bedroom apartment. We are a 501(c)(3), licensed foster based animal rescue organization and ALL donations are tax deductible.

In this apartment, we store thousands of pounds of dog food, 50 crates at a time, and every other supply the rescue uses, so much that it took over much of the basement and an entire bedroom. During our last group rescue, we had 19 dogs and about 20 people here. We hope to rescue 30 dogs next group, going up from there. To say the very least, our efforts are outgrowing this tiny 2 bedroom apartment. 

Note: We are foster home based, meaning we do not keep animals here. They are all sent into foster as soon as they arrive after receiving medical and behavioral exams and are bathed. Our kennel system would be used for those with behavior issues preventing them from staying in foster or those inbetween foster homes.

It's time that we move into a shelter. We have included in our amount we hope to raise- rent for a building, heat/ water/ energy, a dog kennel system, grooming and bathing stations, 2 laptops, a commercial vehicle to be able to continue to rescue groups.

Our plan is to continue to remain a foster home based animal rescue, but to use the shelter for intake, those inbetween foster homes, and adoption events. We can only do so much from a 2 bedroom apartment, but the sky is the limit if we can open a facility.

 You can make an automatically reoccurring donation at rescuegang.org/donate. 

We know these numbers sound low, but we're on a mission on a budget. Together, let's save some lives!

Here are photos of the apartment we operate out of.  We NEED this shelter to happen to be able to continue our work and keep growing.

If we do not reach our goal, we will grow our rescue based off what is raised. All money raised will go right into funding the rescue.

Justice for Tinkerbelle,"My name is Abigail. My goal is to raise funds to use as an incentive to offer anyone who has useful information to help find whoever murdered my cat Tinkerbelle. We are hoping to collect more evidence for our ongoing investigation. That being camera footage of the night of Saturday, August 23rd, and the morning of the 24th, or evidence through word of mouth, or scratches and marks that show signs of a cat fighting for her life, or tools that could've been used like a knife and/or saw.

It's scary to think someone was capable of such an act, but I think it's very important that we find who did this before they find their next victim. My cat was taken, brutally murdered, and cleanly cut in half, and half of her was returned to be found. The possibility of it being an animal or a vehicle was ruled out by close inspection by a veterinarian and employees. It doesn't seem like it was a person's first time performing this crime, and if we don't do something to stop them...

Help Save a Lifeline: Support for Vet Bills,"Five years ago, my sister rescued her best friend from Young-Williams Animal Shelter in Knoxville. Since that day, he has been her whole world—her emotional support, her shadow, her comfort through every hard moment. He is not just a dog. He is family.

Two weeks ago, he suddenly stopped eating. What started as skipping meals turned into constant vomiting and terrifying nights of waking up to him sick and weak. My sister rushed him to the vet, where he endured endless tests, X-rays, ultrasounds, IV fluids, and medications. Still, no clear answers. He has anemia, his red blood cells are under stress, and now they’ve found a possible stomach obstruction. Worst of all, he has something called “Fever of Unknown Origin.” Without a diagnosis of the cause, it cannot be treated. He is weak, not taking food, and not turning the corner. Through it all, he’s been so brave, but he’s fading. My sister has already spent over $7,000 desperately trying to save him, but the costs keep climbing. She would give anything for him, but she’s running out of options. The next steps—specialists and advanced treatment—are simply more than she can afford.

This dog is her lifeline. She’s had him for five years, and in that time he’s been there through heartbreak, anxiety, and every long work-from-home day. He’s the one who never leaves her side. We can’t lose him.

We are asking for help, with humbled hearts, to give him the fighting chance he deserves. Even the smallest donation, or simply sharing this, could help us save him.

Help Save Jackson County Animal shelter,"My name is Chloe, and I'm raising money for the jackson county animal shelter because I believe every animal deserves a safe, loving environment and access to proper care.

Right now, they are facing increasing costs for food, medical care, vaccinations, spay/neuter services, and basic shelter maintenance. Many animals come in sick, injured, or neglected, and without enough funding, the shelter struggles to give them the second chance they deserve.

Help Frankie live a pain free life.,"Help Frankie live a better life! My brother and his family recently adopted this sweet girl from a shelter near the Houston, TX area. Once Frankie was situated in their home, they noticed she was moving strangely and acting like she was in pain. They took her to the vet where she as diagnosed with Bilateral Hip Dysplasia. This was not fully disclosed by the animal shelter prior to adoption. The shelter only stated that Frankie had a small hip issue that made her run funny like a bunny hop. Due to the severity of Frankie’s condition, she underwent Femoral Head Ostectomy surgery yesterday. This was a large, unexpected cost to my brother and his family but they felt it was the right thing to do. The other option was to return her to the shelter where she would likely be euthanized. Frankie is only about 1 year old and still has a lot of life and love to give. Once she recovers from surgery, she will need at least 6 weeks of physical therapy. My brother and his family would never ask for or expect financial assistance, so I created this Go Fund Me on their behalf.

Our animal shelter burned down. Pls help us.,"In November of 2020 , our offical Katty Korner Rescue burned down due to our neighbors gas tank that exploded unexpectedly. Thankfully, we were able to get inside fast enough and rescue all of our animals inside. It was terrifying and we are still trying to recover from all of our losses from this traumatic event. We struggled to find a place to take all of our rescues but luckily found a small house that we began renting for the time being. It is not ideal but it got the job done. Unfortunately our landlord just told us that he will not be renewing our lease and that we need to be out by September. We have over 30 adult cats , 15 dogs , and a pregnant ferral cat that will soon be having her kittens. We desperatly need to find a new place to establish our rescue.

Northern NJ Animal Shelter Struggling to Stay Open,"START II is an abbreviation for Save The Animals Rescue Team II and that is exactly what we do.  We rescue abandoned, abused, and also animals from kill shelters. 
 
Our animal shelter is in dire straits.  Our bills, that MUST be paid ON TIME, have increased drastically. Pet insurance alone, costs over $4000. annually. Our VET bills, vary month to month, but are never low, and can be unpredictably high, but must be paid every month. The medical bills are a tremendous drain on the limited funds of our non-profit; for instance, some of our meds are no longer manufactured in the U.S. and must be imported from Germany. Thus the prices increase. It seems that our kitties’ vet bills are always high since their viruses/infections spread through their population very quickly from one cat to another. Since January, the medical bills alone amounted to over $20,000. 

We also travel to local needy areas to participate in cat SPAY / RELEASE, to curb the feral population.



Since we are a no-kill shelter, sometimes our pets can languish in the shelter a bit longer,  which consumes our available funds also. I remember one dog that came to us from a high-kill shelter in the spring and was not adopted until Christmas. But we are committed to continuing our NO-KILL status because our prime mission is to get all of them adopted into caring homes. We take this responsibility very seriously, and carefully screen all our prospective adoptive families. Sometimes, our pets are returned and we accept that eventuality, even though we are definitely saddened by it. Sometimes, however, the fit is just not right.

 We try to control our expenses by seeking out the lowest prices for our food supplies and meds, etc. ( even having a paper towel donation contest with our volunteer group ), but in spite of this, more funds are needed IMMEDIATELY, to keep our shelter doors open to all.
We participate in all sorts of fundraisers: garage sales, town sales, tricky trays, leaving collection cans at local businesses, selling our handmade catnip balls ( very popular ! ),and semi-annual mailers for donations.

Want to join me in making a difference? I hate to beg, but we are committed to our community of homeless animals, and to the public service we are doing, as our President envisioned when she started this no-kill shelter  40 years ago.

Aid for Diann Bond's Memorial and Family Needs,"There isn’t a fitting introduction to start this. However if you don’t know who I am, I guess I will start there.
My name is Elora Palmer. My mother, Diann Bond, passed away unexpectedly and tragically on Saturday September 20th 2025. There are so many words and yet not enough to describe the kind of person Diann was. She was incredible, smart, motivated, beautiful, and so full of life. Aside from me, she also left behind my twin 16 year old brothers. My grandparents, (her parents), a brother and sister. As well as a granddaughter and nieces and nephews. My family and I are devastated. Broken. Lost. Unable to process that we will never be able to call her again.
Unfortunately, with her passing comes a slew of complicated challenges that we are now facing. I am starting this go fund me to help with things such as: bringing her back home to the states, service arrangements, keeping up with her affairs/bills until things can be fully wrapped up and dealt with, making sure my brothers are taken care of, etc.",6291.0,20000.0,5.0,https://images.gofundme.com/lQAofj9-hJK4p9tMywPtDkDtrBo=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/95088561_1759003495602275_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/aid-for-diann-bonds-memorial-and-family-needs?qid=a3d3014d3624c7c20bb3187cd0a7e5a2,"Smile, Happiness, Facial expression, Event, Fun, Tooth, Jewellery, Entertainment, Party, Necklace",1
"""Hot Dogs"" in Lancaster Animal Shelter.","Updated 7/19/20  Hello, my name is Patti Jerzy. Those who know me, know I am a huge dog/animal lover, & do what I can to help the shelters dogs, cats, & all animals who end up there. I have 4, (ok maybe 5) precious rescued furbabies.  I have been updating the fundraiser with information and the cutest pics of the dogs, loving the ice, as well as a horse, and wait until you see the video of the piggy, so cute.

I was online to donate what I could to East Valley to help their Hot Dogs, when I was advised there was another Shelter without A/C in Lancaster Ca.  That info was erroneous information, as they may not have A/C but they do have a swamp cooler. which I only found out after the fundraiser started, but that did not diminish the need for Ice due to the poor cooling effect of a swamp cooler in high heat and they are pretty much useless on humid days. The kennels are 1/2 They are concrete or steel type cells, where the dogs pretty much live 24/7, due to Covid & the closing of the shelters to the public & volunteers. The cats & other animals are housed in the air-conditioned main building with staff.  Some days the kennels can be cooled to a safe level, but on the very hot days, they need the ice to cool inside the kennels themselves to cool inside, they are too hot, way too hot, for the dogs and can soar to levels that can cause I wanted to help them with the much-needed ice, as has been done in previous years, which were was paid for by donations as well, but I had no idea how costly it would be. Ice vendors are not able to donate, as most people are hurting due to COVID, and I was getting quotes of $500 a day for ice. Next week will be in the 90's & 100's.  I realized I can't do this alone, & I needed help, please. I was able to find a vendor who would discount to  $175 a day for 600 # of ice to help the dogs, we lowered it to $150 day after the first delivery, as the bags were 40# each, and the shelter felt they could manage with 10 bags vs 15. So far our donations paid for ice delivery Thursday, Friday, Sat. & Sunday to the tune of approx. $625, go fund me takes fees for using their platform, which is deducted from the donations.  I'm was hoping to raise donations quickly enough to purchase & donate from all of us, an industrial ice maker. The ice really does help tremendously, as it cools the floor, their water, they play in it, & it does lower the temp in the kennels. The city had plans, now delayed due to Covid, to construct a new building with A/C, < this per the shelter, but not confirmed as of yet. 

I know it's a challenging time for everyone. Any donation, no matter how small or large, for that matter,  will truly help these doggies. Industrial ice makers themselves are over $2500 for large capacity. I had hoped to negotiate the price & purchase the best one with the balance of the fundraiser after we had paid out for the week of ice.   We have done a good job so far, because of all you fabulous donors, but not yet enough to entertain purchasing an industrial Ice make.  I have some other ideas along those lines, please see updates and pictures of the animals enjoying the ice, that will make your heart happy.   We have enough in the fund to pay for Monday and Tuesday, at least, and hopefully the donations will keep coming in for the rest of the week. 

From the bottom of my heart,  I thank each and every one of you who has donated, and I am thanking any new donors in advance.  Every time a donation comes in, it's like winning the lottery for these babies. 

PS, as I mentioned I am looking into other avenues for cooling the kennels.  I have written to the city,  at the suggestion of one of our donors, to see if they can donate or at least move one of the industrial Ice Machines they apparently have, to the shelter.   This has not been confirmed that they do have ice machines in other locations, but I am checking that out, and also researching possible companies who may donate.  Another idea provided by a donor could be stand-alone portable A/C's.  I am checking into those as well and finding out from the shelter if they thought these would and could bring the kennels down to safe levels.  I believe they have 3 buildings for the kennel dogs.

****Lastly, if you could please share this fundraiser once more to your page, as perhaps more people will see it, and more donations would allow us to keep have ice delivered next week when temps reach 100+.",1687.0,2500.0,1904.0,https://images.gofundme.com/DXYyC_L6hWCAxbUmFkLcwvGhkj4=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49686334_1595154667190910_r.jpg,https://www.gofundme.com/f/Hotdogs-in-lancaster-animal-shelter?qid=24b7fcc1b75d583a5827127644c1df23,"Dog, Law enforcement, Canidae, Police officer, Official, Security, Pet Supply, Dog Supply, Working animal",1
Washer & Dryer for Animal Shelter,"The Vermilion County Animal Shelter has been trying to work with using a residential washer and dryer that was donated 3 years ago.  The units were already used when they were donated, and it's believed that they are both at least 10 years old. 
The washer and dryer are on their last leg. They could break down at any time causing serious problems in the daily operation of the shelter.

Hundreds of times a month these appliances are used to clean blankets and bedding for sick or elderly animals.
The need for clean blankets is critical for these animals as it may be their last chance to sleep on some clean bedding. The need for clean laundry is especially important to help stop the spread of any potential disease for any sick animal.

This is where you can help.






The animal shelter has a chance to purchase a commercial washer and dryer for as little as $3500. These units are efficient and will save time, water, and energy. Most animal shelters cannot exist without the use of such commercial machines. 

Please donate now to help the shelter get a new washer and dryer.

Help Ginger Fight FIP,"Our cats Ginger (orange cat) and Mimi (gray cat) were born from the same litter and threatened to be sent to an animal shelter due to a housing situation. We took them both in as an attempt to give them a great life. These cats have grown together for every second of their lives and are now inseparable brothers.

Recently, Ginger was having weird behavior and intense breathing cycles, so we decided to take him to the emergency vet to figure out what was wrong with him. After paying $1,200 out of pocket and waiting 4 hours, we received the news that he was diagnosed with Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP). Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a serious illness in cats caused by a mutated form of a common virus called the feline coronavirus (FCoV). Many cats carry the regular feline coronavirus and don't get sick, but for a select few, like Ginger, it mutates inside the body and turns into the dangerous form that causes FIP. Ginger has ""Dry"" FIP, which causes inflammation in organs like the eyes, brain, or kidneys, leading to symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or neurological signs.",648.0,2000.0,12.0,https://images.gofundme.com/2AJ60Z5w48SKxoBoXwsOAsEDhOE=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94833723_1758390866816795_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/t4ncgs-help-ginger-fight-fip?qid=b7bb97e73049109cac4a80eaef1ddecc,"Cat, Felidae, Vertebrate, Felinae, Carnivores, Fur, Snout, Terrestrial animal, Whiskers, Tail",0

Too many families in Northwest Arkansas face the impossible choice between feeding themselves and feeding their pets. A partial look into local surrender data indicates that nearly 1 in 10 animal surrenders in NWA are due to financial hardship. This comes from a very small set of data and the actual number is likely much larger.

I have first hand experience working in local animal shelters, where I have helped people through the very difficult decision to surrender their pet due to financial circumstances, very often out of their control. Getting help with pet food can often mean the pet can stay with their people, out of the shelter.

Our society is run (no paid staff) and relies heavily on the generosity of those who support our cause.  We also receive Casino funds once every three years which help us cover operating expenses such as veterinary costs, shelter supplies and more.
 
The society originally formed in 2003, after several Nanton residents noticed a in our small rural Alberta town.  One of our founding members, Lynne Maynard, took great efforts early on in our inception to find a facility location for NAPS.  A place for and fill their bellies while she searched for their forever homes. 

By 2007, Lynne was relieved and grateful to have the support of local businessman Kin Leong, owner of Mountain Top Foods.  He happened to have an empty trailer sitting on his property, of which he offered to NAPS.  And so began the lease of the trailer NAPS would call home for the next 10 years.  The generosity of Mr. Leong in our time of need has never been forgotten, and has helped us to have an incredible impact on the lives of countless abandoned, homeless and feral animals.



 Our current Shelter

The current NAPS facility (The Leong building)  is a single wide  trailer, of space, and if you've ever been in the shelter, you'll know that while it isn't cosmetically appealing, it does a good job of providing enough comfortable living space for around 25-30 cats at its fullest.  There is a small ""medical isolation room"" used to monitor cats with illness, and a small supply storage room used to store dishes, medical supplies, food, bedding, and more. Lastly, there is an open concept space, where the shelters residents are uncaged, and free to roam as they would in a home setting.  The cats are entirely free-roaming, choosing to eat/drink/sleep where and when they please.  There are various cat tree's and sleeping spots, windows for natural light and bird watching, and tons of toys donated by our loyal supporters.  There is even an outdoor cat run where when weather permits, the cats can lay in the sun and chase bugs.

PEPPER in our Cat Aviary!


By this time, you may be wondering why NAPS is looking to move.  While the building has been a blessing, it also has its draw backs.

We are unsure of the original use of the building, or even when it was built.  What we do know is that there is .  For almost a decade volunteers have been carting in fresh water required for cleaning, and drinking water for the animals.  We are also required to send our laundry home with volunteers, and use a kettle to heat water for mopping and dishes. 
 
We have been able to make due over the years, however a real and pressing concern for keeping things sterile and safe for our volunteers and the animals exists.  We have had to rely heavily on frequent sterilization with chemicals to ensure we are preventing the spread of disease and keeping things sanitary.  No running water also means , which has been more than an inconvenience for volunteers working at the shelter for lengthy periods of time or even for potential adopters and local youth education programs that visit the shelter.

 Local Cub & Beaver Scouts visit the shelter annually!

Other draw backs of the facility include a .  During the winter months, even with the furnace in working order, the water in the drinking bowls has been known to freeze, leaving cats with no water source between volunteer work shifts.

Attempts to replace windows and reduce heat loss have been made difficult by the overall .  It is an older building, probably never intended for habitation and currently has quite a large amount of rot.  For this reason, structural improvements cannot be completed as required.
 
The cosmetic issues with our current home are more than just an eye sore.  make it hard to sterilize surfaces.  makes things dusty frequently, and can contribute to health issues with the animals living in the shelter.  Keeping the interior temperature manageable throughout the seasons can be difficult as well.

The , and can house only two adult cats at a time, or a mother and litter of nursing kittens.  This is a set back, in that animals newly surrendered to NAPS are to be housed separately from the general population for two weeks to ensure they are healthy and their vaccines have taken affect.  If both kennels in the isolation room are in use, NAPS must turn away any new intakes until those cages become available again.  This is especially trying during kitten season, when NAPS can see as many as 10 separate litters of kittens over a 2 month period.  NAPS turns away multiple surrender requests each month as a result of our lack of space to take in more animals at one time. 

 Our medical isolation room

The shelter's of space can legally hold 33 cats at one time according to the Alberta Humane Society standards.  This may seem like a large number to most, but those who are familiar with the industry can tell you that this is only a small portion of animals in need of our help.  NAPS accepts intakes from and the rural areas in between.  Depending on the time of year, we are approached between 5 and 15 times a month to take in surrenders or trap strays in the mentioned areas.  While there are several other shelters operating in close proximity to us, these shelters are and are overwhelmed with the level of need in their respective areas.  Often times, someone who has been turned away by other area shelters will come to NAPS as a last resort.

The Nanton Animal Protection Society may seem to focus primarily on felines.  This is not by choice.  Our current home does not allow us to safely house multiple species.  There is no safe and humane way to keep canines in the building without risking the health and mental well being of the felines already in our care.  Other animals like small exotics woudnt be safe house with the cats they way things are now.

 TWEETY - a canary surrendered after her owner had been hospitalized long term.

With a larger more functional facility, we could then more efficiently  extend our reach to other animals, such as dogs, reptiles, birds and other exotics, all without having to put pressure on foster homes.  At this time, NAPS works closely with (south of Nanton, Ab) for canine fostering, and relies on individual families for all other foster needs.  If a foster home cannot be arranged, NAPS is forced to turn the surrendered animal away.


Year after year, the need for NAPS has increased as the population of Nanton grows.  Our small facility is no longer meeting the needs of the community and surrounding areas, and we are bursting at the seams!
 
For most of the last the NAPS Building Committee has met with various Town of Nanton Council and Administration members to explore the possibility of the Town leasing a piece of land for NAPS to build on.  Unfortunately, indepth exploration of this possibility concluded that there was not in fact any Town owned land that would suit our needs or budget.



Through the generosity of our supporters and corporate sponsors, in the last five years we have been able to raise enough funds to purchase a
 
generously parcelled off a piece of their property for purchase, and we finalized the sale this spring!  This is a huge step in the right direction!  THANK YOU so much to everyone who helped us come this far!  We couldn't have done it without your generosity!


Additionally, just this month, we were able to secure the purchase of an .  This building will be moved onto our parcel of land in the coming months. 

Purchasing an existing structure and renovating it to suit our needs turned out to be the most cost effective option for NAPS, given our current budget.  Building a structure from scratch was quoted between $200,000.00 and $400,000.00 by local contractors!  Alternatively, NAPS was able to purchase the land and this building for under $60,000.00!!
 

Fundraising efforts moving forward, will be focused on raising the funds required to;
- prepare the land for the building
- pay for all required permits and inspections
- bring utilities to the structure
- complete the necessary renovations to the building such as replacing flooring and walls with non-porous surfaces,framing the interior layout, adding a bathroom, etc.
 
We are also asking for our supporters help in building a next to the main structure, where canines can safely and comfortably be housed and cared for in a unique setting designed for them.
 
Little extras we hope to be able to cover would include;
-  exterior cat and dog runs (chain link enclosures with shade/rain cover)
- andscaping to encourage a welcoming atmosphere for our visitors, volunteers and resident animals alike
- interior needs such as an office desk, filing cabinets, desktop computer, etc
-  animal enrichment items such as cat trees, dog doors, climbing structures, litter box enclosures, etc.

UPDATE: Due to permit and coding issues, the portable was scrapped, and NAPS has decided to move forward with plans to build a faciltiy from scartch!  In addition to the $100k we hope to raise, we have applied for the Community Enhancement Matching Grant which we hope will cover the other $100k required to move forward with building plans.  See our updates for more details!
 
All of these things are estimated to cost us around .  The majority of our previously raised funds have been spent on the purchase of the land and building. We could really use the communities help moving forward!

Hi All,

I started this fundraiser to help Aditi who has been volunteering to help street dogs of Mumbai.
Street Dogs in India do not always receive the love and at times are injured and meet with accidents.
Aditi takes these dogs, feeds them, takes them to the Vet.
She has a shelter but they need some money to fix the roof and feed the animals.

Costs to fix the roof
60,000 Rupees (655 € )

Costs for food , medicine and vaccination 97,000Rupees( 900€ )



Her efforts can be seen on 



I am making this fundraiser to help her as she had to stop her efforts due the lack of funds.

These animals are hurt and abused by people and the care she provides is invaluable.

Let's try and make an effort to help her reach her basic costs to sustain the animal shelter.

Help save our animal shelter,"This Eastside animal shelter is on the verge of closing its doors and needs our help!

You may have seen the story on the local news about the little shelter that could.  

Founded by pound volunteers, PAWS - Pound Animals Worth Saving - has been rescuing Valley animals. Since 2012, they've saved more than 7000 pets from euthanasia and helped them find loving, fur-ever homes. 

The shelter runs on the thinnest of margins and relies heavily on volunteers. Unfortunately, donations and adoption fees have not been enough to cover the expenses involved in maintaining the shelter.



My daughters and I volunteer for the shelter, and I've seen how hard everyone there works and how passionate they are about saving animals. We've fostered multiple dogs and have adopted others, so I've seen the entire process first hand. Helping this organization has been hugely gratifying, and I want to see them not only survive, but succeed and flourish, as well. I am volunteering with them now to help them redo their website and launch a social media campaign.



If you help, you will not only be saving the shelter but the thousands of abandoned pets who might never receive a second chance at life without their help.

Updates will be posted as they become available.

Volunteers are always needed and appreciated for everything from fundraising to cleaning cages to cuddling cuties. Visit the shelter's new website for more information.

They are in the middle of rebranding, so you may see ""P.A.W.S. Fur the Cause - Pound Animals Worth Saving"", and ""Desert Tails Shelter"" used interchangeably during the transition. Numerous television appearances are scheduled that should help alleviate any concerns regarding this matter, but please let us know if you have any questions.

So, lets begin with helping Rocco's family financially during this difficult time.

Save Potato: Urgent Medical Help Needed,"This is Potato.

After finding out my other cat was diabetic, I decided to rehome him to someone who I thought would take great care of him. Unfortunately, that was not the case.

I reached out for months to see how he was doing and said I would take him back if it did not work out. Instead, I was blocked, and I tried for months to get a hold of them. After months of failing, I started to lose hope.

Animal shelter in Spain,"""Helfende Pfoten für Spanien""

Kurz zu uns: Mein Name ist Dr. Sonnenmann (53 Jahre) und meine Frau Tanja (50 Jahre) wir sind beide Rechtsanwälte in Deutschland. Unsere freie Zeit verbringen wir leidenschaftlich in Spanien. Dort haben wir leider festgestellt, dass es den Tieren nicht sehr gut geht. Aus diesem Grund haben wir schon zahlreiche Projekte unterstützt.

Jetzt ist es wieder soweit und wir haben neue Möglichkeiten erhalten.

Tausende Tiere in Spanien benötigen dringend unsere Hilfe! Viele Straßenhunde und -katzen kämpfen ums Überleben, während andere in Tierheimen auf ein neues Zuhause warten.",,,18.0,https://images.gofundme.com/Y1H-UL7CrzcdXtaXro2LoI5O8Qg=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/94637651_1757868681942924_r.png,https://www.gofundme.com/f/animal-shelter-in-spain?qid=89f3e1bb4bfa911b551bc32aee2292c7,"Dog, Animal shelter, Carnivores, Kennel, Mesh, Cage, Pet Supply, Dog Supply, Fence, Canidae",0
